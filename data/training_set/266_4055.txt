In
a
normal
election
year
,
a
normal
candidate’s
close
aide
who
caused
even
minor
embarrassment
to
a
campaign
so
near
to
Election
Day
would
be
whisked
away
as
quickly
as
possible
to
avoid
becoming
a
distraction
.

But
Huma
Abedin
is
not
simply
a
close
aide
,
she’s
a
critical
member
of
Hillary
Clinton’s
tiny
inner
circle
that
protects
and
—
at
times
—
enables
the
deeply
flawed
and
secretive
Democratic
nominee
.

So
despite
<[>FBI<]>
Director
James
Comey’s
announcement
that
the
bureau
is
reviewing
emails
from
Abedin’s
time
at
the
State
Department
reportedly
found
on
a
laptop
she
shared
with
her
soon
-
to
-
be
ex
-
husband
Anthony
Weiner
(
confiscated
as
a
part
of
the
<[>FBI’s<]>
investigation
into
allegations
he
sexted
with
a
15
-
year
-
old
North
Carolina
girl
)
,
the
campaign
made
clear
on
Saturday
that
she’s
not
going
anywhere
.

John
Podesta
,
the
chairman
of
the
Clinton
campaign
,
told
reporters
on
a
conference
call
that
Abedin
had
been
nothing
but
cooperative
with
investigators
and
sat
for
hours
of
depositions
last
summer
as
part
of
the
civil
lawsuit
filed
by
<[>Judicial
Watch<]>
.

“There’s
nothing
that
she’s
done
that
we
think
calls
into
question
anything
that
she’s
done
with
respect
to
this
investigation…
we
fully
stand
behind
her
,
”
Podesta
said
.

But
the
new
information
that
the
<[>FBI<]>
found
State
Department
-
related
email
on
her
home
laptop
also
calls
into
question
whether
Abedin
in
fact
turned
over
all
of
the
devices
she
used
to
send
and
receive
email
while
working
at
State
.

On
June
28
,
2016
,
Abedin
said
under
oath
in
a
sworn
deposition
that
she
looked
for
all
devices
that
she
thought
contained
government
work
on
them
so
the
records
could
be
given
to
the
State
Department
.
(
These
records
were
subsequently
reviewed
by
the
<[>FBI<]>
.
)

“How
did
you
go
about
searching
for
what
records
you
may
have
in
your
possession
to
be
returned
to
the
State
Department
?
”
Attorney
Ramona
Cotca
for
<[>Judicial
Watch<]>
asked
her
.

“I
looked
for
all
the
devices
that
may
have
any
of
my
State
Department
work
on
it
and
returned
—
returned
—
gave
them
to
my
attorneys
for
them
to
review
for
all
relevant
documents
.
And
gave
them
devices
and
paper
,
”
Abedin
answered
.
