Donald
Trump
has
stated
that
,
on
advice
of
his
lawyer
,
he
will
not
release
his
tax
returns
until
his
audit
is
concluded
.

By
contrast
,
Hillary
Clinton
has
released
her
federal
1040
returns
,
(
but
not
her
state
or
possible
other
returns
)
.
Language
on
her
campaign
website
asserts
that
she
and
her
running
mate
“
continue
to
set
the
standard
for
financial
transparency
.
”

The
Clinton
returns
reveal
much
information
,
but
they
reflect
a
standard
short
of
full
financial
transparency
.
More
significantly
,
the
tax
reductions
the
Clintons
receive
when
donating
to
their
foundation
and
the
lower
rate
of
self
-
employment
taxes
they
paid
compared
to
those
who
make
much
less
reflect
some
of
what
is
wrong
with
the
U
.
S
.
tax
system
.
Gross
income
is
the
gross
receipts
minus
their
business
expenses
and
$
3
,
000
of
a
carried
forward
capital
loss
that
started
in
2008
.

Total
federal
taxes
is
their
income
taxes
minus
foreign
tax
credits
(
for
them
,
only
years
2011
-
13
)
*
plus
self
-
employment
taxes
and
additional
taxes
due
to
the
Affordable
Care
Act
(
higher
medicare
taxes
and
taxes
on
investment
income
starting
in
2013
)
*
For
the
Clintons
,
the
foreign
tax
credit
came
to
$
160
,
000
or
less
each
year
from
2011
-
13
and
arose
from
work
done
abroad
.

For
years
2010
-
2015
,
the
table
below
shows
the
Clintons’
reported
gross
income
,
total
federal
taxes
paid
,
charitable
contributions
,
and
the
amount
of
the
latter
going
to
the
<[>Clinton
Foundation<]>
.

What
follows
mainly
focuses
on
the
Clintons’
2014
tax
return
.

Self
-
employment
Income

Almost
all
of
the
Clintons’
gross
income
after
deducting
expenses
(
$
28
,
020
,
811
)
was
derived
from
self
-
employment
:
with
the
biggest
amounts
for
making
speeches
(
slightly
more
than
$
8
.
7
million
made
by
Hillary
and
$
8
.
4
million
by
Bill
)
,
consulting
(
$
6
.
1
million
made
by
Bill
,
)
and
writing
(
$
4
.
6
million
made
by
Hillary
.
)

All
of
their
speaking
income
is
paid
by
The
Harry
Walker
Agency
.
However
,
under
<[>IRS<]>
rules
,
who
paid
the
agency
or
to
whom
they
spoke
is
not
disclosed
.

The
tax
return
indicates
that
$
2
.
125
million
of
Bill’s
consulting
income
,
before
deducting
expenses
,
was
paid
by
<[>Gems
Education<]>
.
A
<[>Wikipedia<]>
article
describes
<[>Gems
Education<]>
as
“
the
largest
operator
of
private
kindergarten
-
to
-
grade
-
12
schools
in
the
world
,
[
that
]
as
of
2015
has
over
70
schools
in
over
a
dozen
countries…”

In
2010
,
Bill
Clinton
“
named
<[>GEMS
Education<]>
a
strategic
partner
of
the
<[>Clinton
Global
Initiative<]>
.
”
According
to
the
tax
returns
,
in
2011
,
for
the
first
time
,
<[>GEMS
Education<]>
paid
Bill
–
$
500
,
000
raising
its
payment
each
year
thereafter
.

Laureate
Education
paid
Bill
$
4
,
292
,
475
.
It
is
described
in
the
<[>New
York
Times<]>
as
“
a
network
of
for
-
profit
schools
.
”

In
2010
,
Laureate
hired
Bill
as
its
new
honorary
chancellor
.
As
disclosed
on
the
tax
returns
,
it
paid
him
over
$
17
.
5
million
from
2010
-
2015
.
Bill’s
visits
to
Laureate’s
campuses
were
described
to
have
“
inspired
”
students
.

The
nature
of
the
advice
Clinton
provided
is
not
part
of
the
tax
return
.

Business
Deductions

Both
Clintons
took
deductions
against
their
self
-
employment
income
.
These
deductions
are
supposed
to
be
ordinary
and
necessary
meaning
they
are
common
and
appropriate
.
Their
expenses
deducted
for
airfare
,
transportation
,
and
hotels
came
to
several
times
what
most
people
earn
at
their
jobs
.

In
2014
,
Bill
claimed
travel
expenses
of
$
375
,
793
for
his
speaking
business
,
an
amount
considerably
less
than
the
$
2
,
018
,
050
spent
on
travel
for
that
business
in
2013
.
By
contrast
,
his
total
travel
expenses
for
his
consulting
business
for
2013
and
2014
together
came
to
less
than
$
600
.

Hillary’s
travel
expenses
for
making
speeches
in
2014
came
to
$
813
,
842
.
Another
$
288
,
504
was
spent
on
travel
for
her
writing
business
in
2014
.

Under
<[>IRS<]>
rules
,
specific
details
such
as
where
they
went
and
stayed
,
and
for
how
long
,
are
not
provided
.

Self
-
employment
tax

Self
-
employment
income
is
subject
to
self
-
employment
taxes
:
social
security
and
medicare
taxes
paid
by
the
self
-
employed
.
In
2014
,
social
security
taxes
were
paid
on
only
the
first
$
117
,
000
of
net
income
at
a
rate
of
12
.
4
%
resulting
in
a
maximum
tax
of
$
14
,
508
.
The
medicare
portion
which
is
2
.
9
%
of
all
net
income
had
no
income
limits
.

If
one
adds
the
Clintons’
2014
self
-
employment
tax
to
their
additional
medicare
tax
under
the
Affordable
Care
Act
,
the
total
comes
to
$
1
,
010
,
090
or
3
.
6
%
of
their
total
net
self
-
employment
income
.

The
Clinton
returns
show
the
gross
unfairness
of
the
self
-
employment
tax
that
leaves
those
with
high
incomes
paying
a
rate
that
is
much
lower
than
those
with
significantly
less
income
.

For
example
,
a
person
making
$
30
,
000
of
self
-
employment
income
after
deducting
expenses
would
pay
a
self
-
employment
tax
of
$
4
,
239
which
is
over
14
%
of
their
self
-
employment
income
,
or
more
than
3
times
the
rate
paid
by
the
Clintons
.

Clintons’
Unearned
Income

From
2011
-
2014
,
the
Clintons
reported
no
dividend
income
from
stock
holdings
,
only
interest
income
.
In
2014
,
it
came
to
only
$
25
,
171
.
All
but
$
464
was
paid
by
<[>JP
Morgan
Chase
Bank<]>
.
How
their
money
is
invested
with
the
bank
is
,
as
allowed
by
the
<[>IRS<]>
,
not
made
clear
–
probably
in
the
form
of
CDs
or
bonds
.

By
contrast
,
in
2007
,
the
Clintons
made
over
$
1
million
in
interest
income
and
over
$
90
,
000
in
dividends
.
All
of
the
latter
is
reported
as
coming
from
trusts
.

In
2007
,
they
also
reported
over
$
15
million
on
the
sale
of
stock
held
by
their
trusts
.
Most
sales
were
for
less
than
$
100
,
000
with
only
one
for
slightly
more
the
$
250
,
000
.
Most
sales
occurred
on
or
before
May
11
reflecting
very
good
timing
since
this
was
shortly
before
the
financial
meltdown
.

Their
stock
holdings
were
diverse
.
They
consisted
of
holdings
in
major
corporations
including
<[>Bank
of
America<]>
,
<[>Wal
-
mart<]>
,
<[>Chevron<]>
,
<[>Exxon<]>
,
<[>General
Electric<]>
,
<[>Honeywell<]>
,
and
<[>Lehman
Brothers<]>
prior
to
its
bankruptcy
.

At
first
glance
,
one
might
see
the
Clintons
as
acting
upon
information
that
the
economy
would
soon
crash
,
but
they
may
have
decided
to
rid
themselves
of
holdings
that
might
be
used
against
Hillary
in
her
run
for
the
presidency
in
2008
.

Reporting
no
dividends
from
2011
-
2014
probably
indicates
no
re
-
entry
into
the
stock
market
after
the
meltdown
,
or
that
they
only
purchased
stocks
that
paid
no
dividends
.

There
is
a
huge
difference
between
their
total
interest
and
dividend
income
in
2007
of
$
1
,
159
,
836
with
their
2014
interest
income
of
$
25
,
171
and
no
dividend
income
.
Despite
the
low
interest
rates
,
how
could
their
dividend
and
interest
income
have
plummeted
so
much
?

Given
the
size
of
their
total
income
all
these
years
,
one
has
to
wonder
if
they
have
been
spending
it
all
or
investing
it
in
ways
that
do
not
show
up
on
their
tax
returns
.
4

This
raises
other
questions
.
Have
they
been
making
large
gifts/political
donations
or
paying
large
personal
legal
bills
?
Have
they
set
up
an
entity
that
handles
investments
and
pays
taxes
on
the
income
generated
instead
of
passing
it
through
to
them
individually
to
report
on
their
tax
return
?

Charitable
Contributions

Those
who
usually
receive
the
biggest
reduction
in
their
taxes
per
dollar
donated
are
those
with
the
highest
income
because
they
are
in
a
higher
tax
bracket
.
Many
charitable
donors
receive
no
tax
reduction
because
they
do
not
itemize
their
deductions
.
In
2014
,
the
Clinton
donation
to
their
foundation
of
$
3
million
reduced
their
taxes
$
1
,
188
,
000
–
39
.
6
%
of
the
money
donated
,
not
including
a
probable
savings
of
state
taxes
.
This
level
of
savings
can
be
viewed
as
a
government
subsidy/giveaway
to
the
rich
since
it
reduces
the
government’s
revenue
and
allows
the
money
donated
to
be
used
to
support
and
finance
the
policies
of
their
own
foundation
.

In
2014
,
all
but
$
200
of
their
remaining
charitable
contributions
,
$
22
,
500
,
went
to
two
churches
.
From
2010
-
2015
,
2014
was
the
only
year
specified
contributions
went
to
religious
organizations
.

Comparison
to
Romney
2010
Return

In
2010
,
the
Romneys
reported
on
their
tax
return
gross
income
of
$
21
,
661
,
344
.
Despite
a
gross
income
that
was
$
8
million
more
than
the
Clintons
that
year
,
their
total
federal
tax
came
to
less
than
14
%
of
their
gross
income
,
$
3
,
009
,
766
–
over
$
1
,
000
,
000
less
than
the
amount
of
federal
taxes
paid
by
the
Clintons
.

The
main
reason
for
the
Romneys’
lower
taxes
was
because
most
of
their
income
came
from
investments
which
were
taxed
at
a
lower
rate
(
a
policy
that
began
when
Bill
Clinton
was
president
)
while
the
bulk
of
the
Clinton
income
was
“
earned
”
income
which
is
taxed
at
a
higher
rate
.

Like
the
Clintons
,
the
Romneys
saved
on
their
taxes
by
making
donations
.
$
1
.
525
million
went
to
their
church
and
over
$
1
.
45
million
of
stock
was
donated
to
their
own
foundation
.
It
in
turn
made
donations
to
entities
including
<[>Brigham
Young
University<]>
,
The
George
W
.
Bush
Library
,
and
the
<[>Harvard
Business
School<]>
.

Why
All
of
the
Above
Smells
Foul

The
rich
are
said
to
be
different
than
most
people
.
One
difference
is
that
three
of
the
last
four
major
party
candidates
for
the
presidency
had
their
own
foundation
.
This
suggests
that
having
a
foundation
could
be
a
future
requirement
for
being
taken
seriously
as
a
candidate
.

By
releasing
their
returns
,
the
Clintons
have
acted
with
more
transparency
than
Trump
.

Trump
may
be
hiding
something
,
but
the
Clinton
returns
raise
many
questions
whose
answers
should
be
of
concern
to
voters
.

The
Clinton’s
gross
income
declined
sharply
in
2015
from
over
$
28
million
in
2014
to
$
10
,
745
,
378
.
Nevertheless
,
this
“
lower
”
income
could
arouse
disgust
given
the
levels
of
poverty
in
the
world
and
unmet
basic
needs
of
millions
.

The
low
level
of
taxes
the
rich
pay
under
the
<[>IRS<]>
rules
allow
for
the
massing
of
fortunes
which
normally
go
untaxed
during
their
lifetimes
,
except
for
whatever
property
taxes
they
pay
on
the
real
estate
they
own
.

.
By
signing
his
Form
1040
return
,
Trump
indicated
,
as
stated
above
one’s
signature
that

“
Under

I
declare
that
I

they

”

If
what
he
submitted
is
“
true

”
shouldn’t
he
be
willing
to
share
his

otherwise

The
capital
loss
started
in
2008
when
the
Clintons
disposed
of
a
holding
they
acquired
in
2003
of
<[>Yucaipa
Partnerships<]>
showing
a
loss
of
$
726
,
761
.

The
Clinton
ties
to
Yucaipa
weren’t
all
costly
.
According
to
the
2007
tax
return
,
<[>Yucaipa
Global
Holdings<]>
paid
the
Clintons
over
$

75
million

(
The
relationship
between
<[>Yucaipa
Global

and
the
disposed
<[>Yucaipa
Parnerships<]>
is

to

There
was
no
income
from
Yucaipa
during
subsequent
years
reported
on
a
Schedule

where
one
reports
partnership
income
as
had
been
reported

There
are
no
indications
on
the
tax
returns
that
the
Clintons
invested
in
real
estate
.
From
2007
through
2015
,
their
property
taxes
remained
around
$
100
,
000
.
The
only
exception
is
2013
when
it
jumped
to
$
128
,
098
,
but
then
went
back
down
to
$
