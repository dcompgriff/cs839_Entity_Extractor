“I
am
writing
to
inform
you
that
the
investigative
team
briefed
me
on
this
yesterday
,
and
I
agreed
that
the
<[>FBI<]>
should
take
appropriate
investigative
steps
designed
to
allow
investigators
to
review
these
emails
to
determine
whether
they
contain
classified
information
,
as
well
as
to
assess
their
importance
to
our
investigation
,
”
Comey
continued
.

Although
he
said
that
he
“cannot
assess
whether
or
not
this
material
may
be
significant
,
”
he
believed
it
to
be
“important
to
update
your
Committees
about
our
efforts
in
light
of
our
previous
testimony
.
”

The
general
election
,
of
course
,
is
in
11
days

In
an
election
race
that
had
<[>GOP<]>
nominee
Donald
Trump
fighting
to
catch
up
,
he
needed
a
development
of
significant
enough
import
to
level
the
playing
field
,
and
he
may
have
just
gotten
it
.

Although
this
election
is
far
from
over
,
Donald
Trump
was
just
given
another
real
chance
,
particularly
in
battleground
states
where
he
has
been
struggling
.

Conversely
,
this
also
does
not
mean
the
the
<[>FBI<]>
is
suddenly
going
to
do
an
about
face
and
recommend
prosecution
for
Hillary
Clinton
.
She
has
already
escaped
that
once
during
this
investigation
when
Comey
essentially
slapped
her
wrist
and
called
it
a
day
.

Rush
Limbaugh
on
Friday
said
that
a
cynical
observer
might
conclude
that
Comey
was
in
Clinton’s
pocket
and
had
announced
the
re
-
opened
investigation
to
draw
attention
away
from
recent
<[>WikiLeaks<]>
revelations
of
impropriety
at
the
<[>Clinton
Foundation<]>
that
had
finally
begun
to
attract
mainstream
media
attention
.
