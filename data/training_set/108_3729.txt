At

The
President
of
the
United
States
,
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
world
,
used
a
pseudonym
to
communicate
with
Secretary
of
State
Hillary
Clinton
on
her
private
,
unsecured
email
server
.
As
Andrew
McCarthy
contended
,
that
was
the
reason
the
<[>FBI<]>
declined
to
prosecute
Clinton
,
because
the
president
would
have
been
part
of
the
same
action
,
and
that
wouldn’t
be
politically
correct
.

The
current
president
of
the
United
States
is
also
on
record
that
,
contrary
to
custom
,
he
will
linger
in
Washington
DC
for
a
few
years
.
Wherever
he
chooses
to
live
,
the
email
intrigue
suggests
continuing
back
-
channel
communications
with
Hillary
Clinton
,
should
she
become
president
.
That
invites
a
look
at
what
the
man
the
<[>New
York
Times<]>
dubbed
“
Obama’s
narrator
,
”
the
White
House
adviser
who
sat
closest
to
the
president
and
signed
off
on
his
every
word
,
had
to
say
about
the
president’s
vision
of
the
future
.

“
Few
of
the
decisions
he
had
made
would
satisfy
the
politics
of
the
moment
,
”
David
Axelrod
explained
in
his
massive
2015
<[>Believer<]>
.
“
But
at
home
and
abroad
,
Obama
was
playing
a
longer
game
.
”
As
he
explained
in
Columbia
,
Missouri
,
on
October
30
,
2008
,
“
We
are
five
days
away
from
fundamentally
transforming
the
United
States
of
America
.
”

If
this
man
was
a
liberal
,
as
Barry
Rubin
wondered
in
Silent
Revolution
:
How
the
Left
Rose
to
Political
Power
and
Cultural
Dominance
,
why
did
he
see
a
need
fundamentally
to
transform
a
nation
shaped
by
liberals
such
as
Franklin
Roosevelt
with
his
New
Deal
and
Lyndon
Johnson
with
his
Great
Society
?
He
saw
the
need
because
he
was
not
a
liberal
but
a
lifelong
leftist
radical
.

As
David
Horowitz
explained
in
Volume
7
of
the
Black
Book
of
the
American
Left
,
the
president
was
“
born
,
bred
and
trained
in
the
progressive
movement
.
”
His
mentors
were
“
Communists
and
their
progressive
successors
,
”
so
no
wonder
he
presided
over
“
the
institutionalizing
of
the
policies
of
the
left
in
government
”
for
eight
years
.
What
that
means
in
practical
terms
is
becoming
painfully
evident
.

The
economy
remains
sluggish
and
under
Obamacare
,
the
president’s
signature
plan
,
premiums
are
skyrocketing
.
This
suggests
that
,
as
many
believe
,
Obamacare
was
simply
a
demolition
plan
.
In
the
“
longer
game
,
”
designated
successor
Hillary
Clinton
will
impose
government
monopoly
healthcare
,
what
some
candidates
erroneously
call
“
socialized
medicine
.
”

As
Rubin
noted
,
the
goal
of
the
left
is
“
to
convince
Americans
the
exact
opposite
of
what
their
experience
proved
:
that
the
country
had
fundamentally
failed
and
the
old
leftist
solutions
were
the
answer
.
”
The
result
“
may
be
a
very
long
-
term
and
even
permanent
change
of
the
United
States
into
something
else
,
a
nation
far
less
affluent
and
far
less
free
.
”
And
far
less
secure
,
as
David
Axelrod
also
indicates
.

Vladimir
Putin
makes
an
appearance
in
Believer
but
Obama’s
narrator
does
not
outline
Putin’s
background
in
the
<[>KGB<]>
.
The
believer
includes
nothing
about
Putin’s
role
in
East
Germany
,
a
Stalinist
police
state
that
walled
in
its
subjects
and
shot
those
attempting
to
escape
.
The
narrator
avoids
Putin’s
belief
that
the
breakup
of
the
Soviet
Union
was
“
the
greatest
geopolitical
catastrophe
of
the
century
.
”

In
Believer
,
Putin
tells
the
president
,
“
You
are
a
highly
educated
man
.
I
come
from
the
security
sector
.
”
The
believer
then
asks
the
president
for
his
assessment
of
Putin
.

“
He’s
smart
,
tough
,
clear
about
his
interests
and
without
a
trace
of
sentimentality
,
”
the
president
says
.
That
is
not
very
strong
language
for
a
<[>KGB<]>
veteran
and
expansionist
autocrat
.

In
his
narrator’s
account
,
the
president
uses
the
word
“
