How
did
the
"
growing
trust
"
that
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
once
said
marked
his
"
working
and
personal
relationship
with
President
Obama
"
change
into
today’s
deep
distrust
and
saber
-
rattling
?

Their
relationship
reached
its
zenith
after
Mr
.
Putin
persuaded
Syria
to
give
up
its
chemical
weapons
for
verified
destruction
,
enabling
Mr
.
Obama
at
the
last
minute
to
call
off
,
with
some
grace
,
plans
to
attack
Syria
in
late
summer
2013
.
But
at
an
international
conference
in
the
Russian
Black
Sea
resort
of
Sochi
last
week
,
Mr
.
Putin
spoke
of
the
"
feverish
"
state
of
international
relations
and
lamented:
"
My
personal
agreements
with
the
President
of
the
United
States
have
not
produced
results
.
"
He
complained
about
"
people
in
Washington
ready
to
do
everything
possible
to
prevent
these
agreements
from
being
implemented
in
practice
"
and
,
referring
to
Syria
,
decried
the
lack
of
a
"
common
front
against
terrorism
after
such
lengthy
negotiations
,
enormous
effort
,
and
difficult
compromises
.
"

A
month
earlier
,
Russian
Foreign
Minister
Sergey
Lavrov
,
who
chooses
his
words
carefully
,
told
Russian
TV
viewers
,
"
My
good
friend
John
Kerry
…
is
under
fierce
criticism
from
the
U
.
S
.
military
machine
.
Despite
[
Mr
.
Kerry’s
]
assurances
that
the
US
commander
in
chief
,
President
Barack
Obama
,
supported
him
in
his
contacts
with
Russia
(
he
confirmed
that
during
his
meeting
with
President
Vladimir
Putin
)
apparently
the
military
does
not
really
listen
to
the
commander
in
chief
.
"

Do
not
chalk
this
up
to
paranoia
.
The
U
.
S
.
-led
coalition
air
strikes
on
known
Syrian
army
positions
killing
scores
of
troops
just
five
days
into
the
September
cease
-
fire
–
not
to
mention
statements
at
the
time
by
the
most
senior
US
generals
–
were
evidence
enough
to
convince
the
Russians
that
the
Pentagon
was
intent
on
scuttling
meaningful
cooperation
with
Russia
.

Relations
between
the
US
and
Russian
presidents
have
now
reached
a
nadir
,
and
Mr
.
Putin
has
ordered
his
own
defense
ministry
to
throw
down
the
gauntlet
.
On
Oct
.
6
,
ministry
spokesman
Maj
.
Gen
.
Igor
Konashenkov
said
Russia
is
prepared
to
shoot
down
unidentified
aircraft
–
including
any
stealth
aircraft
–
over
Syria
,
and
warned
ominously
that
Russian
air
defense
will
not
have
time
to
identify
the
origin
of
the
aircraft
.

It
seems
possible
that
the
US
air
force
will
challenge
that
claim
in
due
course
–
perhaps
even
without
seeking
prior
permission
from
the
White
House
.
Last
week
,
<[>National
Intelligence<]>
Director
and
former
<[>Air
Force<]>
General
James
Clapper
commented
offhandedly
,
"
I
wouldn’t
put
it
past
them
to
shoot
down
an
American
aircraft
…
if
they
felt
it
was
threatening
their
forces
on
the
ground
.
"

Injecting
additional
volatility
into
the
equation
,
major
news
outlets
are
playing
down
or
ignoring
Russia’s
warnings
.
Thus
,
Americans
who
depend
on
the
corporate
media
can
be
expected
to
be
suitably
shocked
by
what
that
same
media
will
no
doubt
cast
as
naked
aggression
out
of
the
blue
if
Russian
air
defenses
down
a
US
or
coalition
aircraft
.

Meanwhile
in
Europe
,
as
<[>NATO<]>
defense
ministers
met
in
Brussels
on
Wednesday
,
Defense
Secretary
Ashton
Carter
told
reporters
the
US
is
contributing
"
a
persistent
rotational
armored
brigade
combat
team
"
as
a
"
major
sign
of
the
US
commitment
to
strengthening
deterrence
here
.
"

"
This
was
a
decision
made
by
the
alliance
leaders
in
Warsaw
,
"
he
explained
,
referring
to
<[>NATO’s<]>
July
summit
meeting
in
the
Polish
capital
.
"
The
United
States
will
lead
a
battalion
in
Poland
and
deploy
an
entire
battle
-
ready
battalion
task
force
of
approximately
900
soldiers
from
the
2nd
<[>Cavalry
Regiment<]>
,
which
is
based
in
Germany
.
"

On
Thursday
,
at
the
Valdai
Conference
in
the
Russian
Black
Sea
resort
of
Sochi
,
President
Putin
accused
the
West
of
promoting
the
"
myth
"
of
a
"
Russian
military
threat
,
"
calling
this
a
"
profitable
business
that
can
be
used
to
pump
new
money
into
defense
budgets
…
expand
NATO
and
bring
its
infrastructure
,
military
units
,
and
arms
closer
to
our
borders
.
"

Myth
or
not
,
German
Foreign
Minister
Frank
-
Walter
Steinmeier
was
correct
to
point
out
last
spring
that
military
posturing
on
Russia’s
borders
will
bring
less
regional
security
.
Mr
.
Steinmeier
warned
against
"
saber
-
rattling
,
"
adding
that
,
"
We
are
well
advised
not
to
create
pretexts
to
renew
an
old
confrontation
.
"

Speaking
of
such
pretexts
,
it
is
high
time
to
acknowledge
that
the
marked
increase
in
East
-
West
tensions
over
the
past
two
and
a
half
years
originally
stemmed
from
the
Western
-
sponsored
coup
d’état
in
Kiev
on
Feb
.
22
,
2014
,
and
Russia’s
reaction
in
annexing
Crimea
.
Americans
malnourished
on
the
diet
served
up
by
"
mainstream
"
media
are
blissfully
unaware
that
two
weeks
before
the
coup
,
<[>YouTube<]>
published
a
recording
of
an
intercepted
conversation
between
US
Assistant
Secretary
of
State
Victoria
Nuland
and
the
US
ambassador
in
Kiev
,
during
which
"
Yats
"
(
for
Arseniy
Yatsenyuk
)
was
identified
as
Washington’s
choice
to
become
the
new
prime
minister
of
the
coup
government
in
Kiev
.

This
unique
set
of
circumstances
prompted
George
Friedman
,
president
of
the
think
-
tank
STRATFOR
,
to
label
the
putsch
in
Kiev
on
Feb
.
22
,
2014
,
"
really
the
most
blatant
coup
in
history
.
"

It’s
time
for
Western
politicians
and
media
to
learn
their
lesson
and
pay
attention
to
the
statements
coming
out
of
Russia
.
Ask
yourselves:
Why
all
this
hype
now
?

Ray
McGovern
,
like
Sam
Adams
,
began
a
career
as
a
<[>CIA<]>
analyst
under
President
Kennedy
;
working
on
Vietnam
,
they
became
close
associates
.
Sam
was
too
straight
-
arrow
to
go
to
the
media
about
the
unconscionable
fraud
regarding
the
number
of
Communist
forces
.
Ray
knew
that
and
rationalized
not
doing
so
himself
.
So
,
while
a
close
associate
of
Sam
Adams
years
ago
,
Ray
fell
short
of
the
standard
set
by
the
above
awardees
,
who
deserved
to
be
honored
by
Sam
Adams
Associates
for
Integrity
in
Intelligence
.
