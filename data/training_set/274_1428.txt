However
,
the
man
added
that
as
soon
as
the
Muslims
realized
they
were

not
in
a
mosque
and
that
the
shawls
were
of
religious
importance
to

Judaism
,
“they
immediately
apologized
,
folded
the
shawls
and
explained

that
they’d
just
looked
for
a
place
to
pray
.
”
Sounds
pretty
grown
up
to
me
.
They
were
Turks
though
,
not
Barbarians
.
