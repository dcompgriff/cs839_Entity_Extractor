The

s
we
approach
the
final
months
of
the
Obama
presidency
,
it’s
clear
that
the
“change”
in
foreign
policy
that
candidate
Obama
promised
voters
has
not
materialized
.
His
pledges
to
end
the
Iraq
War
,
to
pursue
a
nuclear
-
free
world
,
to
improve
relations
with
Russia
,
to
act
as
an
honest
broker
between
Israel
and
Palestine
,
and
to
improve
relations
with
the
Arab
world
have
all
been
left
unfulfilled
.
That
his
likely
successor
,
former
secretary
of
state
Hillary
Clinton
,
is
to
the
right
of
the
president
on
matters
of
national
security
is
,
in
a
way
,
an
all
-
too
-
fitting
monument
to
an
era
of
dashed
expectations
.

As
of
this
writing
,
more
than
5
,
000
troops
are
deployed
in
Iraq
and
nearly
10
,
000
in
Afghanistan
.
These
deployments
run
parallel
with
the
dangerously
misconceived
interventions
in
Libya
and
Syria
and
a
counterproductive
drone
war
that
stretches
from
the
Maghreb
and
the
Arabian
Peninsula
to
the
mountains
and
plains
of
Central
Asia
.
Worryingly
,
the
Obama
administration
has
given
these
military
adventures
a
veneer
of
legality
by
deriving
justification
from
the
Authorization
for
Use
of
Military
Force
passed
by
Congress
on
September
14
,
2001
.
These
US
interventions
are
supported
by
nearly
2
.
1
million
reserve
and
active
-
duty
troops
,
200
,
000
of
whom
are
stationed
overseas
at
a
yearly
cost
of
$
600
billion
.
By
some
estimates
,
the
US
military
is
currently
operating
in
more
than
160
countries
.

Meanwhile
,
in
addition
to
waging
a
new
and
more
dangerous
cold
war
with
Russia
,
the
administration—which
views
the
South
China
Sea
as
a
core
national
interest—launched
the
so
-
called
“Asia
pivot
,
”
which
moves
US
policy
toward
China
from
one
largely
based
on
shared
business
interests
to
one
that
seeks
to
contain
China’s
rise
.
The
president’s
much
-
publicized
trip
to
Southeast
Asia
this
year
was
a
good
indication
that
Washington
intends
to
surround
and
isolate
China
by
employing
“bandwagoning”
states
like
Vietnam
.

It
was
widely
assumed
that
Obama
would
pick
up
the
pieces
of
the
Bush
years
and
exorcise
hegemonic
fantasies
from
the
body
politic
.
Instead
,
over
his
two
terms
in
office
,
the
convergence
of
the
neoconservative
and
Wilsonian
interventionist
creeds
has
solidified
into
orthodoxy
.
No
better
evidence
of
this
exists
than
the
fact
that
the
neocons
who
served
as
the
instigators
and
defenders
of
George
W
.
Bush’s
foreign
policy
have
become
devoted
supporters
of
Hillary
Clinton
.
Robert
Kagan
,
Max
Boot
,
and
Eliot
Cohen
,
among
others
,
have
all
voiced
their
preference
for
Clinton
over
the
Republican
nominee
,
Donald
Trump
.

This
is
less
surprising
than
it
might
first
seem
.
After
all
,
the
neoconservative
and
Wilsonian
weltanschauungs
are
,
like
Marxism
,
teleological:
History
,
for
them
,
has
specific
and
definable
ends
.
For
the
neocons
and
Wilsonians
(
also
commonly
known
,
in
recent
decades
,
as
liberal
interventionists
)
,
humanity’s
march
toward
democracy
is
not
only
in
sight
,
but
achievable
.
America’s
foreign
-
policy
orthodoxy
can
be
summed
up
by
the
claim
made
by
then–Secretary
of
State
Madeleine
Albright
,
during
Bill
Clinton’s
presidency
,
that
America
is
the
one
“indispensable
nation”
because
“we
stand
tall
.
We
see
further
into
the
future
.
”

Obama’s
UN
ambassador
,
Samantha
Power
,
expressed
well
an
integral
element
of
this
orthodoxy
when
she
recently
wrote
that
“it
is
now
objectively
the
case
that
our
national
interests
are
increasingly
affected
not
just
by
what
happens
between
states
,
but
also
by
how
people
are
treated
within
states
[
emphasis
added
]
.”

Power’s
casual
disregard
for
the
Westphalian
principle
of
noninterference
in
the
internal
affairs
of
other
states
,
now
de
rigueur
among
interventionists
of
both
parties
,
is
fused
with
a
belief
in
American
global
hegemony
,
of
which
the
Obama
administration’s
2010
Quadrennial
Defense
Review
is
representative:

The
United
States
remains
the
only
nation
able
to
project
and
sustain
large
-
scale
operations
over
extended
distances
.
This
unique
position
generates
an
obligation
to
be
responsible
stewards
of
the
power
and
influence
that
history
,
determination
,
and
circumstance
have
provided
.

Clearly
,
change
has
failed
to
materialize
.
Instead
,
Obama
remains
firmly
in
the
grip
of
a
foreign
-
policy
orthodoxy
that
he
himself
has
dismissed
as
“the
Washington
playbook
,
”
and
which
the
scholar
Andrew
Bacevich
describes
as
the
“faith
-
based
belief
in
American
global
primacy
to
be
pursued
regardless
of
how
the
world
may
be
changing
and
heedless
of
costs
.
”
In
late
October
,
The
Washington
Post
observed
that
while
“it
is
not
unusual
for
Washington’s
establishment
to
launch
major
studies
in
the
final
months
of
an
administration
,
”
the
flurry
of
recommendations
coming
from
Washington
think
tanks
like
the
Center
for
American
Progress
“reflect
a
remarkable
consensus
among
the
foreign
policy
elite
.
”
Perhaps
the
question
that
will
flummox
future
historians
most
as
they
survey
the
record
of
the
Obama
years
is
this:
How
did
a
president
who
so
eloquently
and
cogently
promised
a
break
with
the
past
become
captive
to
the
regnant
orthodoxy
calling
for
seemingly
endless
interventions
abroad
?

As
it
became
more
and
more
difficult
to
deny
that
the
2003
invasion
of
Iraq
was
a
debacle
,
George
W
.
Bush
tried
to
justify
his
administration’s
policies
by
appropriating
the
language
of
the
Wilsonians
in
an
attempt
to
make
his
actions
palatable
to
the
guardians
of
respectable
opinion
.
In
his
second
inaugural
address
,
Bush
proclaimed:
“It
is
the
policy
of
the
United
States
to
seek
and
support
the
growth
of
democratic
movements
and
institutions
in
every
nation
and
culture
,
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
ending
tyranny
in
our
world
.
”
By
employing
such
language
,
Bush
cleared
the
way
for
the
convergence
of
the
neoconservative
and
Wilsonian
ideologies
,
which
have
now
congealed
into
the
orthodoxy
holding
US
foreign
policy
hostage
.

That
orthodoxy
is
enforced
by
what
historian
William
Appleman
Williams
has
described
as
the
“climate
of
assumption
.
”
This
prevailing
climate
is
shaped
by
an
“inside
-
outside”
dynamic
,
whereby
the
narrative
that
defines
any
given
crisis
is
set
on
the
“inside
,
”
by
administration
officials
and
sitting
ambassadors
,
and
reinforced
on
the
“outside
,
”
by
the
establishment
media
.
What
amounts
to
is
a
process
of
preemptive
agenda
-
setting
.
In
the
case
of
policy
regarding
Syria
,
Libya
,
and
Russia
,
the
inside
-
outside
dynamic
has
shaped
a
narrative
that
seeks
to
delegitimize
the
regimes
in
question
,
thereby
obviating
the
need
for
nuance
and
crowding
out
the
moral
,
consequential
,
or
realist
implications
of
any
given
policy
decision
.
It
is
therefore
exceedingly
difficult
,
even
for
a
chief
executive
with
Obama’s
obvious
talents
,
to
depart
from
this
orthodoxy
,
because
of
the
way
it
narrows
the
spectrum
of
“acceptable”
policy
options
.
*

The
Obama
administration’s
counterproductive
intervention
in
Syria
stems
from
an
interpretation
of
the
Arab
Spring
,
painted
by
administration
insiders
and
the
establishment
media
,
as
a
series
of
peaceful
,
pro
-
democracy
mass
movements
.
Such
movements
were
deemed
deserving
of
US
support
because
,
according
to
the
democratic
-
peace
theory
(
a
key
tenet
of
the
neoconservative/Wilsonian
ideologies
)
,
the
spread
of
democracy
is
de
facto
in
US
interests
;
as
the
oft
-
stated
argument
goes
,
democracies
don’t
wage
war
against
one
another
.

The
protests
that
roiled
Syria
in
the
spring
of
2011
surely
gave
voice
to
elements
of
the
population
with
legitimate
grievances
against
the
Assad
regime
.
But
did
that
necessarily
mean
that
the
overthrow
of
the
country’s
secular
government
would
serve
US
national
interests—or
the
interests
of
the
vast
majority
of
Syrians
?
That
question
never
seems
to
have
been
asked
,
because
the
orthodoxy
deemed
it
out
of
bounds
.
The
Syrian
narrative
was
set
early
on:
Bashar
al
-
Assad
,
an
obstacle
to
democratization
and
killer
of
his
own
people
,
“must
go
.
”

The
pr

The
narrative
of
illegitimacy
,
once
established
,
allows
for
almost
anything
,
regardless
of
the
legality
or
morality
of
the
chosen
policy
.
Witness
former
CIA
director
David
Petraeus’s
call
for
Washington
to
ally
with
elements
of
Al
Qaeda
in
Syria
,
or
the
US
government’s
funding
of
the
Nour
al
-
din
al
-
Zinki
movement
,
which
beheaded
a
12
-
year
-
old
boy
in
July—to
say
nothing
of
the
CIA’s
illegal
and
counterproductive
train
-
and
-
equip
program
,
which
has
only
served
to
prolong
the
Syrian
conflict
.

A
similar
dynamic
played
out
during
the
Libyan
crisis:
Very
early
on
,
the
president—driven
by
rumors
circulated
as
fact
in
the
establishment
media
that
Libyan
dictator
Moammar
El
-
Gadhafi
was
about
to
conduct
a
wholesale
massacre
in
the
rebel
stronghold
of
Benghazi—declared
that
he
“must
leave
.
”
The
narrative
of
impending
slaughter
was
reinforced
by
a
spate
of
breathless
news
reports
and
op
-
eds
.

Yet
the
basis
of
the
administration’s
case
for
intervention
proved
to
be
illusory
.
There
was
not
then
,
nor
is
there
now
,
a
shred
of
evidence
that
Gadhafi
intended
to
unleash
a
genocidal
slaughter
in
Benghazi
.
And
this
was
clear
at
the
time:
As
University
of
Texas
scholar
Alan
Kuperman
pointed
out
in
April
2011
,
“The
best
evidence
that
Khadafy
did
not
plan
genocide
in
Benghazi
is
that
he
did
not
perpetrate
it
in
the
other
cities
he
had
recaptured
either
fully
or
partially—including
Zawiya
,
Misurata
,
and
Ajdabiya
,
which
together
have
a
population
greater
than
Benghazi
.
”

But
no
matter:
Once
the
narrative
was
set
,
the
orthodoxy
dictated
intervention
in
spite
of
the
fact
,
as
reported
by
Rolling
Stone
in
2011
,
that
Gadhafi’s
son
Saif
“tried
to
arrange
a
phone
call
with
Hillary
Clinton
,
thinking
he
could
talk
the
Americans
out
of
intervening
.
But
when
Saif
placed
the
call
,
Clinton
refused
to
speak
to
him
.
”
NATO
intervened
in
March
2011
,
and
Gadhafi
was
dead
by
October
,
creating
a
vacuum
that
has
since
been
filled
by
civil
war
and
the
rise
of
ISIS
.

In
the
case
of
Russia
,
the
administration’s
call
to
oust
Vladimir
Putin
has
been
tacit
rather
than
overt
.
After
Putin’s
decision
to
stand
for
election
in
March
2012
,
the
goal
of
isolating
Russia
with
an
eye
toward
regime
change
became
default
US
policy
.
Indeed
,
in
March
2011
,
the
Russian
politician
Boris
Nemtsov
wrote
that
Vice
President
Joe
Biden
told
a
gathering
of
opposition
figures
in
Moscow
that
if
he
were
Putin
,
“he
would
not
stand
for
president
in
2012
because
this
would
be
bad
for
the
country
and
for
himself
.
”

After
that
,
the
narrative
was
set:
Putin
,
returning
for
a
third
term
in
the
Kremlin
,
was
to
be
treated
as
an
obstacle
to
be
removed
.
For
proof
of
this
,
one
need
look
no
further
than
an
e
-
mail
from
Hillary
Clinton
,
then
secretary
of
state
,
to
a
departing
aide
in
February
2012
,
in
which
she
noted
that
she
was
pleased
to
see
the
aide
heading
to
the
White
House
to
“plan
and
execute
our
Russia
strategy
post
-
Putin
.
”

The
push
by
inside
and
outside
voices
to
brand
Putin’s
Russia
as
an
outlaw
state
picked
up
steam
in
the
winter
of
2013–14
,
with
the
start
of
the
Maidan
revolution
in
Ukraine
.
Recall
that
the
initial
cause
of
the
rift
between
the
protesters
and
the
Ukrainian
government
was
over
the
latter’s
failure
to
sign
an
association
agreement
with
the
European
Union
.
And
while
US
national
-
security
interests
weren’t
even
remotely
at
stake
,
that
was
beside
the
point:
The
agreement
included
trade
and
security
provisions
that
would
have
effectively
wrenched
Ukraine
from
Russia’s
traditional
sphere
of
influence
,
and
it
was
pursued
regardless
of
the
consequences
,
which
have
included
the
violent
overthrow
of
Ukraine’s
democratically
elected
president
and
a
civil
war
that
has
killed
nearly
10
,
000
people
.
By
the
end
of
2015
,
the
United
States
had
provided
Ukraine
with
$
2
billion
in
loan
guarantees
and
nearly
$
760
million
in
security
assistance—all
part
of
a
needless
and
costly
new
cold
war
with
Russia
that
could
one
day
be
seen
as
President
Obama’s
principal
foreign
-
policy
legacy
.
*
*

In
addition
to
the
inside
-
outside
dynamic
between
the
administration
and
establishment
media
,
Washington’s
think
tanks
and
NGOs
play
an
important
role
as
enforcers
of
orthodoxy—one
that
has
become
increasingly
pronounced
over
the
course
of
the
Obama
administration
.
While
purporting
to
be
nonpartisan
,
outfits
like
the
Center
for
a
New
American
Security
(
CNAS
)
and
the
Brookings
Institution
in
effect
launder
neoconservative
policy
proposals
by
dressing
them
up
in
the
softer
,
more
palatable
language
of
Wilsonianism
.
In
just
the
past
few
years
,
think
tanks
have
served
as
incubators
and
champions
of
policies
like
arming
Ukraine
and
overthrowing
the
government
of
Syria
.

Often
,
these
organizations
are
deeply
compromised
by
their
funders
.
For
example
,
after
Brookings
accepted
$
14
.
8
million
from
the
government
of
Qatar—which
has
financed
Salafist
terrorist
groups
like
Syria’s
Nusra
Front
(
now
the
Levant
Conquest
Front
)
—the
think
tank
published
an
op
-
ed
that
made
the
case
for
Syria’s
radical
Sunni
extremist
group
Ahrar
al
-
Sham
,
arguing
against
“designating
[
it
]
as
a
terrorist
organization
.
”

Washi

Analysts
associated
with
Brookings
and
its
center
in
Qatar—whose
co
-
chair
is
Sheikh
Hamad
bin
Jassim
bin
Jaber
al
-
Thani
,
a
former
prime
minister
and
member
of
the
Qatari
ruling
family—have
repeatedly
complained
that
the
Obama
administration
isn’t
doing
enough
to
help
the
“moderate”
opposition
in
Syria
.
And
yet
Gerd
Müller
,
Germany’s
international
-
development
minister
,
told
The
Telegraph
in
2014
,
“You
have
to
ask
who
is
arming
,
who
is
financing
[
ISIS
]
troops
.
The
keyword
there
is
Qatar
.
”
Indeed
,
it
has
recently
come
to
light
that
Hillary
Clinton
shared
Müller’s
concerns
,
noting
in
an
August
2014
e
-
mail
to
John
Podesta
that
the
Qatari
and
Saudi
governments
“are
providing
clandestine
financial
and
logistic
support
to
ISIL
and
other
radical
Sunni
groups
in
the
region
.
”

This
June
,
while
Democratic
Representative
(
and
combat
veteran
)
Tulsi
Gabbard
was
pushing
a
bill
to
defund
the
CIA’s
train
-
and
-
equip
program
in
Syria
,
Brookings
senior
fellow
Shadi
Hamid
took
to
Twitter
to
declare
that
“@TulsiGabbard
might
be
one
of
worst/least
knowledgeable
foreign
policy
thinkers
in
Democratic
party
.
Not
just
bad
ideas
,
but
dangerous
ones
.
”
Hamid
followed
this
up
with:
“Neo
-
isolationist
left
(
@tulsigabbard
)
&
far
right
(
Trump
)
have
pretty
similar
views
on
how
Putin’s
actually
not
so
bad:
He
can
help
on
ISIS
!
”

In
smearing
Gabbard
,
Hamid
was
only
echoing
the
sentiments
of
his
colleague
in
Qatar
,
Charles
Lister
,
who
had
previously
accused
Gabbard
of
being
“the
Democratic
Party’s
chief
defender

”
As
Brookings
fellows
,
Hamid
and
Lister
take
their
role
as
enforcers
of
the
orthodoxy
seriously—as
well
they
might
,
since
Gabbard’s
legislation
,
if
passed
,
would
be
a
serious
setback
for
the
grand
designs
of
Beltway
Caesars
like
themselves
.

In
addition
to
plumping
for
further
involvement
in
Syria
,
Hamid
has
tried
to
whitewash
the
administration’s
disastrous
Libya
intervention
,
which
even
Obama
has
admitted
was
his
“worst
mistake
.
”
Hamid
,
though
,
claims
it
was
“successful
,
”
arguing:
“The
country
is
better
off
today
than
it
would
have
been
had
the
international
community
allowed
dictator
Muammar
Qaddafi
to
continue
his
rampage
across
the
country
.
”
Never
mind
that
a
civil
war
has
been
ravaging
Libya
for
the
past
five
years
.

In
addition
to
producing
op
-
ed
columns
of
questionable
value
,
think
tanks
also
influence
the
climate
of
assumption
by
publishing
special
reports
that
are
meant
to
serve
as
guides
for
policy
-
makers
.
Indeed
,
sometimes
the
resemblance
between
government
memoranda
and
think
-
tank
literature
is
uncanny
,
as
was
the
case
this
past
June
when
CNAS
Middle
East
director
Ilan
Goldenberg
was
pleased
to
point
out
the
“many
similarities”
between
the
State
Department’s
hawkish
“dissent
channel”
cable
on
Syria
and
a
CNAS
report
titled
“Defeating
the
Islamic
State:
A
Bottom
-
Up
Approach
.
”
Both
,
needless
to
say
,
called
for
greater
US
involvement
in
the
Syrian
civil
war
.

In
the
past
year
,
CNAS
has
published
several
notable
reports
that
have
advocated
,
among
other
things
,
the
wider
use
of
drones
(
“The
Promise
of
Unmanned
Systems
in
the
Asia
Pacific”
)
;
increased
military
spending
and
more
overseas
commitments
(
“Extending
American
Power:
Strategies
to
Expand
U
.
S
.
Engagement
in
a
Competitive
World
Order”
)
;
directly
arming
the
Syrian
opposition
(
“From
the
Bottom
,
Up:
A
Strategy
for
U
.
S
.
Military
Support
to
Syria’s
Armed
Opposition”
)
;
and
yet
more
military
spending
(
“While
We
Can:
Arresting
the
Erosion
of
America’s
Military
Edge”
)
.
Even
the
ostensibly
center
-
left
Center
for
American
Progress
recently
unveiled
a
report
that
urged
the
imposition
of
a
no
-
fly
zone
over
Syria
,
a
move
that
Hillary
Clinton
herself
has
admitted
,
albeit
behind
closed
doors
,
risks
the
possibility
of
a
wider
war
and
would
“kill
lots
of
Syrians
.
”

Meanwhile
,
the
Atlantic
Council
(
funded
in
part
by
the
US
government
and
NATO
)
has
released
a
series
of
articles
and
reports
urging
greater
action
in
Ukraine
.
In
February
2015
,
in
conjunction
with
Brookings
and
the
Chicago
Council
on
Global
Affairs
,
it
released
“Preserving
Ukraine’s
Independence
,
Resisting
Russian
Aggression:
What
the
United
States
and
NATO
Must
Do
,
”
which
urged
the
administration
to
arm
Kiev
.

Over
the
past
few
years
,
the
Atlantic
Council
has
gone
from
espousing
a
sensible
,
if
staid
,
transatlanticism
to
producing
some
of
the
most
virulent
specimens
of
the
new
cold
-
war
propaganda
.
Examples
of
its
prodigious
output
relating
to
Russia
and
the
Ukraine
crisis
can
be
seen
in
reports
like
“Human
Rights
Abuses
in
Russia
-
Occupied
Crimea”
(
August
2015
)
;
“Hiding
in
Plain
Sight:
Putin’s
War
in
Ukraine”
(
October
2015
)
;
and
“Arming
for
Deterrence”
(
July
2016
)
.
Not
surprisingly
,
in
addition
to
NATO
and
the
US
government
,
the
Atlantic
Council
lists
the
Ukrainian
World
Congress
,
the
Ukrainian
oligarch
Victor
Pinchuk
,
the
Lithuanian
government
,
and
the
Latvian
embassy
among
its
many
funders
.

There
is
also
the
collusion
between
private
,
ostensibly
nongovernmental
organizations
and
those
agencies
of
the
US
government
that
seek—and
sometimes
,
in
the
case
of
Ukraine
,
manage
to
engineer—regime
-
change
movements
.
The
founding
father
of
what
might
be
called
“ideological
humanitarianism”
is
surely
the
financier
and
self
-
styled
political
philosopher
George
Soros
,
who
,
through
his
network
of
Open
Society
Foundations
,
seeks
to
influence
and
leverage
civil
-
society
opposition
groups
in
countries
throughout
Eastern
Europe
.



Soros
has
spawned
many
imitators
.
Perhaps
the
most
emblematic
of
the
new
techno
-
crusaders
is
eBay
founder
Pierre
Omidyar
,
whose
involvement
in
the
Ukraine
uprising
has
complemented
Washington’s
.
According
to
journalist
Mark
Ames
,
“The
American
government—in
the
form
of
the
US
Agency
for
International
Development
(
USAID
)
—played
a
major
role
in
funding
opposition
groups
prior
to
the
revolution
.
”
Ames
also
notes
that
a
large
percentage
of
the
funding
for
those
groups
came
from
Omidyar
.

Indeed
,
Omidyar’s
work
has
been
praised
by
none
other
than
Samantha
Power
,
who
,
in
November
2013
,
singled
him
out
as
an
heir
to
Soros
in
a
speech
hailing
the
“new
philanthropists”
who
are
working
to
advance
the
vision
that
“George
popularized
and
resourced:
open
economy
,
open
government
,
open
society
.
”
And
while
it’s
certainly
the
case
that
the
Open
Society
Foundations
have
done
valuable
work
in
the
fields
of
public
health
and
criminal
-
justice
reform
,
particularly
here
in
the
United
States
,
Soros’s
activism
takes
on
a
decidedly
less
benign
character
abroad
.
A
recent
tranche
of
leaked
Open
Society
e
-
mails
shows
that
Soros
was
actively
trying
to
shape
the
politics
of
post
-
Maidan
Ukraine
.
In
a
meeting
with
US
Ambassador
Geoffrey
Pyatt
in
March
2014
,
Soros
urged
Washington
to
provide
“professional
PR
assistance
to
[
the
]
Ukrainian
government
,
”
while
also
voicing
his
opinion
that
the
neofascist
group
Right
Sector
was
little
more
than
“an
FSB
[
Federal
Security
Service
]
plot”
funded
by
Russia
“to
destabilize
Ukraine
.
”

The
US
government
,
in
appointing
itself
the
global
arbiter
of
legitimacy
,
has
set
a
series
of
dangerous
precedents
.
Today
,
the
United
States
reserves
the
right
to
intervene
anywhere
in
the
world
,
regardless
of
the
consequences
,
morality
,
or
costs
in
blood
and
treasure
.
In
the
Middle
East
,
US
interventions
have
created
space
for
ISIS
in
Iraq
,
Syria
,
and
Libya
,
while
our
alleged
allies
Saudi
Arabia
,
Turkey
,
and
Qatar
have
been
among
the
principal
benefactors
of
ISIS
and
like
-
minded
religious
extremists
.

In
addition
to
what
is
fast
becoming
a
strange
obsession
with
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
,
the
foreign
-
policy
establishment
has
turned
a
blind
eye
to
the
ravages
of
the
Ukrainian
civil
war
,
as
well
as
to
the
fact
that
the
main—and
perhaps
insuperable—obstacle
to
the
implementation
of
the
2014
Minsk
cease
-
fire
agreement
is
the
US
-
supported
and
-
funded
government
in
Kiev
,
which
boasts
a
neo
-
Nazi
as
its
parliamentary
speaker
.

As
we
approach
November
8
,
it
is
clear
that
this
foreign
-
policy
orthodoxy
is
something
the
establishment
takes
on
faith
.
But
foreign
policy
should
not
be
a
faith
-
based
business
.
Progressives
and
like
-
minded
anti
-
interventionist
conservatives
and
libertarians
need
to
alert
the
American
public
to
this
dangerous
state
of
affairs
and
fashion
a
coherent
,
sound
,
and
popular
alternative
to
the
orthodoxy
holding
US
foreign
policy
hostage
.
That
may
require
the
formation
of
a
21st
-
century
peace
movement
,
with
allies
inside
a
“peace”
wing
of
the
Democratic
Party
.
A
second
Clinton
administration
looks
increasingly
likely
;
if
that
is
the
case
,
the
progressive
,
responsible
left
will
have
to
serve
as
a
check
on
its
interventionist
impulses
.
This
will
not
be
easy
,
nor
should
we
delude
ourselves
about
the
prospects
for
success
.

But
we
must
,
for
all
our
sakes
,
attempt
it
.
