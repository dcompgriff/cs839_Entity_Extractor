17
years
of
age
(

4
million
)
have
been
diagnosed
with
ADHD
as
of
2011

diagnosis
continues
to
increase
,
from

and
an
average
of
approximately
5
%
per
year
from
2003
to
2011
.
Boys
(
13
.
2
%
)
were
more
likely
than
girls
(
5
.
6
%
)
to
have
ever
been
diagnosed
with
ADHD
.
The
average
age
of
ADHD
diagnosis
was
7
years
of
age
,
but
children
reported
by
their
parents
as
having
more
severe
ADHD
were
diagnosed
earlier
.
Prevalence
of
ADHD
diagnosis
varied
substantially
by
state
,
from
a
low
of
5

6
%
in
Nevada
to
a
high
of
18

7
%
in
Kentucky
.
What
Exactly
Are
We
Dealing
With
Here
?
One
big
problem
we
are
dealing
with
is
the
label
of
ADHD
itself
.
By
simply
treating
characteristics
of
ADHD
as
a
disability
(
something
we
so
commonly
see
in
education
)
we
are
destroying
the
potential
and
self
esteem
of
so
many
children
.
Diagnosing
a
child
with
a
mental
disorder
based
on
their
lack
of
ability
and/or
desire
to
pay
attention
in
a
classroom
seems
absurd
,
doesn’t
it
?
In
fact
,
in
my
opinion
it’s
down
right
crazy
.
Not
wanting
to
,
or
not
having
the
ability
to
pay
attention
to
information
that
does
not
nourish
the
soul
,
spark
the
heart
or
capture
the
mind
is
in
no
way
characteristic
of
a
mental
disability
,
but
something
that
seems
completely
normal
.
Perhaps
we
should
stop
looking
at
the
student
and
focus
more
on
the
environment
we
surround
our
children
with
?
If
it’s
not
stimulating
enough
for
some
students
,
that
does
not
mean
they
have
a
mental
disorder
and
should
be
given
harmful
medications
.
Some
of
these
children
will
be
in
their
own
world
and
downright
refuse
to
pay
attention
,
trying
to
amuse
themselves
any
way
they
possibly
can
,
doing
what
they
want
to
do
and
not
what
others
tell
them
to
do
.
These
children
have
become
targets
for
pharmaceutical
companies
and
targets
for
what
might
very
well
be
a
false
labeling
campaign
based
on
very
little
science
.
Characteristics
associated
with
ADHD
are
in
no
way
a
“disability
.
”
In
fact
,
there
is
evidence
to
suggest
that
these
characteristics
might
be
more
associated
with
“abilities”
that
should
be
placing
many
of
these
children
in
gifted
school
programs
instead
of
special
education
programs
.
Unfortunately
,
new
data
from
the
National
Center
for
Learning
Disabilities
shows
that
only
1
percent
of
students
who
receive
services
for
their
apparent
“learning
disabilities”
(
some
of
which
are
completely
and
unquestionably
valid
)
are
enrolled
in
gifted
or
talented
programs
.
The
report
concluded
that
“students
with
learning
and
attention
issues
are
shut
out
of
gifted
and
AP
programs
,
held
back
in
grade
level
and
suspended
from
school
at
higher
rates
than
other
students
.
”

This
is
a
pretty
disturbing
characteristic
,
and
what
makes
it
even
more
disturbing
is
the
fact
that
recent
work
in
cognitive
neuroscience
shows
that
both
creative
thinkers
,
and
those
with
an
ADHD
diagnosis
show
difficulty
in
suppressing
brain
activity
that
comes
from
the
“
Imagination
Network
.
”
(

)
(

)
There
are
no
school
assessments
that
provide
evaluation
on
creativity
and
imagination
,
these
are
hard
to
draw
up
and
measure
and
receive
very
little
attention
in
our
education
systems
.


In
fact
,
something
that’s
touched
upon
in
the
paragraph
below
,
a
tremendous
amount
of
research
shows
that
people
who
show
characteristics
of
ADHD
are
more
likely
to
reach
higher
levels
of
creative
thought
and
achievement
compared
to
those
who
don’t
show
these
characteristics
.

Research
also
shows
that
these
characteristics
are
associated
with
the
broadening
of
attention
,
and
those
who
have
them
tend
to
have
a
mental
“filter
.
”
In
other
words
,
it’s
their
choice
what
they
chose
to
give
their
attention
to
,
and
they
are
very
selective
and
stern
when
it
comes
to
that
.
Scott
Barry
Kaufman
,
the
Scientific
Director
of
The
Imagination
Institute
in
the
Positive
Psychology
Center
at
the
<[>University
of
Pennsylvania<]>
says
that
:
“Of
course
,
whether
this
is
a
positive
thing
or
a
negative
thing
depends
on
the
context
.
The
ability
to
control
your
attention
is
most
certainly
a
valuable
asset
;
difficulty
inhibiting
your
inner
mind
can
get
in
the
way
of
paying
attention
to
a
boring
classroom
lecture
or
concentrating
on
a
challenging
problem
.
But
the
ability
to
keep
your
inner
stream
of
fantasies
,
imagination
,
and
daydreams
on
call
can
be
immensely
conducive
to
creativity
.
By
automatically
treating
ADHD
characteristics
as
a
disability–
as
we
so
often
do
in
an
educational
context–
we
are
unnecessarily
letting
too
many
competent
and
creative
kids
fall
through
the
cracks
.

Another
interesting
piece
of
information
to
note
is
that
in
2004
,
an
author
by
the
name
of
Gary
Davis
reviewed
a
large
portion
of
literature
from
1961
to
2003
and
identified
22
recurring
personality
traits
of
creative
people
,
most
of
which
were
very
positive
and
associated
with
the
same
personality
traits
as
people
who
have
been
diagnosed
with
ADHD
.
Some
of
these
traits
included:
independence
,
risk
taking
,
high
energy
,
curiosity
,
humor
,
emotional
and
artistic
.
Some
of
the
negative
ones
included:
impulsive
,
argumentative
and
hyper
active
.
He
published
his
findings
in
his
book
“
Creativity
is
Forever
.
”
It’s
not
the
children
,
they
do
not
have
a
disability
of
any
kind
.
They
simply
have
a
different
way
of
learning
,
and
with
a
lack
of
differentiated
instruction
in
modern
day
education
systems
,
having
a
child
spend
8
hours
a
day
in
such
a
non
-
stimulating
environment
is
wrong
.
The
solution
isn’t
feeding
our
children
drugs
that
have
been
proven
to
be
extremely
harmful
in
multiple
ways
so
that
a
child
is
almost
forced
to
pay
attention
and
listen
,
but
rather
changing
the
environment
that
surrounds
the
student
to
make
it
more
simulating
and
exciting
.
This
is
a
tough
task
in
modern
day
education
,
and
something
educational
institutions
struggle
with
on
a
daily
basis
.
These
children
do
not
need
to
be
singled
out
and
labelled
with
something
that
might
be
completely
fictitious
.
Is
ADHD
Even
Real
?
When
I
was
in
school
I
received
this
diagnosis
,
alongside
a
learning
disability
and
more
.
As
a
child
I
always
knew
I
was
perfectly
fine
,
that
everything
I
did
and
what
I
decided
to
pay
attention
to
was
simply
my
choice
.
I
always
felt
that
none
of
the
labels
and
the
explanations
that
accompanied
them
were
valid
at
all
,
and
I
personally
refused
to
take
any
medication
that
was
being
recommended
to
me
.
I
am
very
glad
I
didn’t
.

I
am
also
a
qualified
,
certified
teacher
for
grades
7
-
12
.
Through
volunteer
as
well
as
work
experience
my
views
on
this
subject
matter
did
not
change
at
all
,
but
strengthened
.
I
have
interacted
with
these
children
,
as
well
as
those
within
special
education
programs
(
with
multiple
“disabilities
)
and
the
way
we
label/view
them
is
(
in
my
opinion
)
completely
100
percent
backwards
and
does
nothing
but
harm
.
The
labels
and
descriptions
alone
that
education
uses
to
define
these
kids
is
even
worse
.
The
fact
that
children
who
“have
trouble”
paying
attention
to
what
they
are
not
interested
in
are
diagnosed
and
placed
into
the
disability
category
simply
based
on
observation
alone
is
a
frightening
thought
,
and
I
am
glad
I’m
not
the
only
one
who
has
asked
this
question
.
There
are
many
examples
,
and
one
of
the
most
recent
comes
from
Neurologist
Dr
Richard
Saul
.
Richard
Saul
is
a
neurologist
who
has
had
a
long
career
in
examining
patients
who
have
been
having
trouble
with
short
attention
spans
and
an
inability
to
focus
.
From
his
first
hand
experience
,
he
feels
that
ADHD
is
nothing
more
than
a
fake
disorder
that
is
really
only
an
umbrella
of
symptoms
and
not
actually
a
disease
.
He
strongly
feels
that
it
should
not
be
listed
as
a
separate
disorder
in
the
American
Psychiatric
Association’s
Diagnostic
&
Statistical
Manual
.
You
can
read
more
about
that
here
.
“We
have
a
habit
of
always
seeing
issues
in
people
who
don’t
fit
in
with
the
system
.
Whether
they
don’t
want
to
be
in
standard
education
,
don’t
want
to
work
their
whole
lives
or
have
trouble
focusing
on
things
they
don’t
like
,
we
tend
to
label
this
as
a
problem
,
but
is
it
?
Maybe
we
just
don’t
look
within
enough
to
figure
out
what
might
really
be
going
on
or
why
we
are
living
the
way
we
do
.
Perhaps
it
is
time
we
let
go
of
the
idea
of
having
to
“fit
in”
to
something
that
doesn’t
resonate
rather
than
labelling
it
as
a
disorder
.

Joe
Martino
,

of
Collective
Evolution
.
It’s
also
important
to
note
that
,
according
to
an
article
written
in
the
The
German
Weekly
,
the
founding
father
of
ADHD
,
American
psychiatrist
Leon
Eisenberg
in
a
death
bed
interview
said
that
“ADHD
is
a
prime
example
of
a
fictitious
disease
.
”
The
article
was
written
by
Der
Spiegel
and
has
made
its
way
around
the
web
for
years
.
I
cannot
however
completely
verify
that
this
statement
was
actually
true
.
(

)
It’s
also
important
to
note
the
pharmaceutical
drug
aspect
into
this
equation
.
For
(
one
small
out
of
many
)
example
(
s
)
,
American
psychologist
Lisa
Cosgrove
and
others
investigated
Financial
Ties
between
the
<[>Diagnostic
and
Statistical
Manuel
of
Mental
Disorders<]>
(
<[>DSM<]>
)
panel
members
and
the
pharmaceutical
industry
.
They
found
that
,
of
the
170
<[>DSM<]>
panel
members
95
(
56
%
)
had
one
or
more
financial
associations
with
companies
in
the
pharmaceutical
industry
.
One
hundred
percent
of
the
members
of
the
panels
on
‘mood
disorders’
and
‘schizophrenia
and
other
psychotic
disorders’
had
financial
ties
to
drug
companies
.
The
connections
are
especially
strong
in
those
diagnostic
areas
where
drugs
are
the
first
line
of
treatment
for
mental
disorders
.
In
the
next
edition
of
the
manual
,
it’s
the
same
thing
.
(
11
)
(
12
)
“The
<[>DSM<]>
appears
to
be
more
a
political
document
than
a
scientific
one
.
Each
diagnostic
criteria
in
the
<[>DSM<]>
is
not
based
on
medical
science
.
No
blood
tests
exist
for
the
disorders
in
the
<[>DSM<]>
.
It
relies
on
judgments
from
practitioners
who
rely
on
the
manual
.

There
is
lots
of
evidence
to
suggest
that
Pharmaceutical
companies
have
influenced
certain
psychiatrists
to
“pathologize”
certain
behavior
as
a
mental
illness
so
more
drugs
can
be
marketed
to
the
masses
.
In
my
opinion
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
,
but
we’ll
save
that
for
another
article
as
it
is
a
big
topic
.
There
are
lots
of
things
to
