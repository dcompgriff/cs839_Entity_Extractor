BARACK
Obama
has
admitted
he
was
born
in
Kenya
and
‘you
can
all
go
fuck
yourselves’
.

At
a
White
House
press
conference
,
the
soon
to
be
former
president
confirmed
he
had
thoroughly
enjoyed
his
time
in
office
and
had
been
lying
about
his
birth
certificate
all
along
.

He
said:
“Job
done
.
Got
to
live
here
for
eight
years
.
It
is
a
seriously
nice
place
.
I
also
had
a
huge
plane
and
a
helicopter
and
I
could
play
golf
whenever
I
wanted
.
”

He
added:
“Anyway
,
enjoy
this
total
shitfest
.
I’m
going
to
become
a
professor
,
or
head
of
some
big
<[>UN<]>
thing
.
”

President
Obama
then
laughed
and
went
back
to
watching
a
marathon
session
of
Salvage
Hunters
and
looking
at
a
brochure
for
‘one
of
those
massive
Audis’
.
