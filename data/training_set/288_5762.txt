At
this
point
in
the
election
run
-
up
,
we
know
an
awful
lot
about
Republican
candidate
Donald
Trump
–
probably
more
than
we
want
to
.

But
there’s
one
thing
about
him
that
has
puzzled
a
lot
of
people
–
his
use
of
the
word
‘bigly
.
’

What
the
heck
does
it
mean
?
Is
he
trying
to
use
it
as
you’d
use
a
word
such
as
‘largely’
or
‘finally’
?
Would
the
opposite
of
‘bigly’
be
‘littlely’
?
Is
his
grasp
of
the
English
language
really
that
bad
?

He
has
used
it
a
lot
in
his
campaign
speeches
,
and
it
has
even
been
transcribed
and
reported
at
times
as
‘bigly
.
’
Some
people
have
decided
he’s
actually
saying
‘big
league
.
’
Others
aren’t
so
sure
.

It
turns
out
that
it’s
not
his
vocabulary
that’s
at
fault
,
it’s
his
pronunciation
.

Raymond
Navarro
of
<[>Catholic
broadcaster
EWTN<]>
asked
him
directly
in
an
interview
this
week
if
he’s
saying
‘bigly’
or
‘big
league
.
’
Trump
responded
:
“I
use
big
league
.
”

You
can
see
the
exchange
on
25:05
in
this
video
clip
from
the
interview
.

The
fact
that
he’s
saying
‘big
league’
was
also
affirmed
by
his
son
Donald
Trump
Jr
.
who
was
asked
about
it
after
the
September
26
presidential
debate
.

So
now
the
mystery
is
over
.
But
not
before
broadcast
and
social
media
had
a
lot
of
bigly
fun
with
it
.
Watch
this
funny
clip
from
<[>Bloomberg<]>
,
which
was
made
before
the
truth
was
revealed
.
It
contains
all
the
bigly/big
league
confusion
you
can
handle
.
