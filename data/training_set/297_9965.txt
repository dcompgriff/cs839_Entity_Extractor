In
September
the
<[>National
ICE
Council<]>
,
representing
some
5
,
000
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
officers
charged
with
protecting
the
country’s
borders
,
did
something
it
has
never
done
:
It
endorsed
a
candidate
for
president
:
Donald
Trump
.
In
its
statement
at
the
time
,
the
union
said
:
In
[
Trump’s
]
immigration
policy
,
he
has
outlined
core
policies
needed
to
restore
immigration
security
—
including
support
for
increased
interior
enforcement
and
border
security
,
an
end
to
Sanctuary
Cities
,
an
end
to
catch
-
and
-
release
,
mandatory
retainers
,
and
the
canceling
of
executive
amnesty
and
non
-
enforcement
directives
.

On
the
contrary
,
said
the
union
,
Hillary
Clinton
supports
furthering
“
amnesty
”
and
a
“
radical
”
immigration
plan
that
will
cost
thousands
of
Americans
not
only
their
jobs
but
their
lives
.

On
Friday
the
union
issued
a
“
final
warning
,
”
expanding
its
concern
about
how
open
borders
would
cost
Americans
their
lives
.
Wrote
the
council’s
president
,
Chris
Crane
:
Hillary’s
pledge
for
‘
open
borders’
will
mean
disaster
for
our
country
,
and
turn
the
present
border
emergency
into
a
cataclysm
.
Hillary’s
plan
would
unleash
violent
cartels
and
brutal
transnational
gangs
into
US
communities
and
cause
countless
preventable
deaths
…
.
<[>ICE<]>
officers
on
the
front
lines
are
witnessing
a
deluge
of
illegal
immigration
unlike
anything
we
have
seen
before
.
The
corporate
-
funded
media
won’t
cover
it
.
Our
officers
are
being
ordered
to
release
recent
border
-
crossers
with
no
idea
what
their
intentions
are
or
what
they
are
planning
.
Gang
members
,
drug
cartels
and
violent
smugglers
are
taking
advantage
of
the
situation
and
threatening
American
communities
.
The
influx
is
overwhelming
public
resources
,
especially
in
poor
communities
—
including
Hispanic
communities
and
immigrant
communities
bearing
the
economic
brunt
of
the
illegal
immigration
surge
.

There
are
economic
,
cultural
,
and
moral
reasons
for
concerns
about
open
borders
,
as
noted
by
economist
Gene
Callahan
.
Unlimited
immigration
would
likely
lead
to
lower
wages
for
Americans
who
would
have
to
cut
their
wage
demands
or
be
replaced
by
immigrant
workers
willing
to
work
for
lower
wages
.

Culturally
an
unlimited
dumping
of
immigrants
onto
an
unprepared
and
unsuspecting
culture
would
alter
that
culture
irreparably
.
Consider
the
Native
American
culture
,
he
said
:
If
Native
Americans
had
been
able
to
limit
the
flow
of
European
immigrants
,
they
might
have
been
able
to
preserve
their
land
and
cultures
.

Morally
there
is
a
responsibility
to
take
care
of
those
less
able
to
care
for
themselves
but
not
to
the
point
of
reducing
their
own
circumstances
to
penury
:
While
the
rich
have
an
obligation
to
help
the
poor
,
that
obligation
does
not
extend
to
the
degree
that
they
must
become
poor
themselves
.

Since
every
resident
in
the
United
States
,
except
maybe
for
those
Native
Americans
,
is
either
an
immigrant
or
a
descendent
of
one
,
it
makes
sense
to
welcome
immigrants
.
Until
1875
,
there
were
no
immigration
laws
.
But
with
the
passage
of
the
Page
Act
of
1875
,
legislators
began
defining
the
procedures
under
which
those
desiring
to
immigrate
into
the
country
would
have
to
follow
.

Since
then
immigration
laws
have
been
heavily
modified
,
but
they
have
always
defined
those
procedures
and
conditions
.
If
the
laws
need
to
be
changed
again
,
then
legislators
should
change
them
.
But
they
must
be
followed
,
not
ignored
for
political
purposes
.
Otherwise
,
unintended
consequences
,
such
as
those
noted
in
the
<[>ICE
Council's<]>
warning
,
will
overtake
the
culture
and
risk
destroying
the
very
culture
that
makes
it
presently
so
inviting
for
those
seeking
a
better
life
.
