While
visiting
a
<[>Chili’s<]>
restaurant
in
Cedar
Hills
,
Texas
,
<[>U
.
S
.
Army<]>
Veteran
Ernest
Walker
was
approached
by
the
manager
and
had
his
military
service
questioned
even
though
he
had
his
military
ID
with
him
.
<[>Chili’s<]>
offers
free
meals
to
Veterans
on
Veterans
Day
as
a
thank
you
for
their
service
,
but
what
Walker
received
was
anything
but
.

Noticing
what
was
happening
,
Walker
took
out
his
phone
and
began
to
record
everything
that
was
being
said
to
him
.
At
one
point
,
even
his
food
was
stripped
away
from
him
.
There’s
really
no
other
way
to
see
this
than
an
act
of
racism
,
and
<[>Chili’s<]>
needs
to
answer
for
it
.

Walker
wrote
on
<[>Facebook<]>
:

“I
went
there
to
get
a
Veterans
meal
and
all
was
good
.
I
had
my
service
dog
with
me
because
I
am
on
Dialysis
and
he
monitors
my
BP
.
I
ordered
the
waitress
was
wonderful
.
It
took
about
35
mins
for
meal
to
come
.
So
when
it
attived
I
gave
her
a
tip
as
asked
for
a
take
out
.
She
said
sure
,
at
that
point
a
old
white
guy
wearing
a
Trump
flag
shirt
walked
buy
me
on
hi
way
to
the
bath
room
.
He
came
back
and
asked
me
what
unit
did
i
serve
in
the
24th
.
I
said
no
the
25th
.
He
said
he
was
in
world
war
2
in
Germany
and
we
did
not
see
people
like
you
over
there
.
They
would
no
allow
blacks
.
I
just
listened
he
left
then
came
back
to
bathroom
again
and
pet
my
dog
.
So
waitress
put
food
in
container
.
Then
the
managers
comes
and
says
a
some
guest
at
the
restaurant
say
that
your
not
a
real
Soldier
.
I
reply
what
are
you
serious
what
guest
.
The
manager
Wesly
Patrick
said
can
I
see
military
ID
.
I
felt
that
was
reasonable
I
most
people
ask
for
that
so
I
showed
him
my
ID
it
checked
out
.
At
that
point
all
he
should
have
said
was
‘Sir
I
am
sorry
Thank
you
for
your
service
and
I
would
have
left
.
But
instead
ge
says
‘
the
guest
also
says
that
your
service
dog
is
not
a
service
dog
.
Now
that’s
when
I
got
upset
and
started
Recording
so
see
for
yourself
what
happened
.
”

Watch
the
altercation
here:

<[>Chili’s<]>
did
respond
by
saying
:

“We
are
aware
of
the
situation
that
happened
at
our
<[>Chili’s<]>
Cedar
Hills
location
yesterday
.
Our
goal
is
to
make
every
guest
feel
special
.
Unfortunately
,
we
fell
short
on
a
day
we
strive
to
honor
our
Veterans
and
active
military
for
their
service
.
We
have
escalated
this
to
the
highest
levels
of
our
company
.
”

Hopefully
,
all
of
this
will
be
resolved
properly
and
Walker
given
the
respect
that
he
deserves
.

The
fact
that
some
manager
of
a
local
<[>Chili’s<]>
restaurant
felt
so
bold
to
question
anyone’s
service
to
deny
them
a
meal
is
just
beyond
comprehension
.
