Transcripts November 3, 2016 Obama: ‘It’s Because of You That a Marine Can Serve His Country Without Hiding the Husband He Loves’ 
Speaking at the University of North Carolina this afternoon, President Barack Obama told voters it was because of them that millions of people had health care who did not have it before and Marines could enter publicly into same-sex marriages. 
“It is because of you that millions of people have health care today that didn’t have it before,” Obama said. “It is because of you that millions of young people are going to college that couldn’t afford it before. It’s because of you that a Marine can serve his country without hiding the husband he loves. It is because of you that more young immigrants came out of the shadows and are serving our country.”
