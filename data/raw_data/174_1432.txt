You know, outside of any morality arguments, it seems to me that asking soldiers to give you money after you ask them to get shot at by other people for the privilege of getting shot at in the first place, doesn't seem like a good idea somehow. Is DC vaguely aware what happens to countries that gyp their troops on a regular basis? Or have they watched so much Star Trek in the break room over the years that they've forgotten that problems are not solved peacefully in 60 minutes, or that we have not become a cashless society yet?
