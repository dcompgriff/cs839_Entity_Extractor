No doubt she prefers it doused liberally with hot sauce from the bottle she carries in her purse at all times . 
It’s one thing to kiss up to different voting blocs when you’re running for elective office: It’s the currency of politics. But when you do it in as transparently crass a manner as Hillary Clinton, you have to wonder why the other guy isn’t beating her by 50 points . 
Here she is, making a guest appearance on the Univision show “El Gordo y La Flaca.” The title translates to “The Fat Man & The Thin Lady,” as the abuela-in-chief could on doubt tell you. See for yourself by watching the portion of the video below beginning at 2:18. As the Thin Lady addresses her audience in rápida e spañol , Clinton nods along as though she has the first clue what the woman is saying. 
Before the panderfest is over, Clinton also adds that her granddaughter is already learning Spanish , which is frankly quite an achievement since the child turned two at the end of September. 
Clinton’s stomach-turning hijinks know no limits. The day after her appearance on Univision, she joined black radio host Charlamagne Tha God live on air where she claimed that rappers had influenced her fashion sense . Tha God was apparently too gracious to ask, “What sense?”
