Dan Notes and Patterns:
*"the" comes before
*"and" comes before or after
*"from" comes before 
*"on" comes before
*"called" comes before
*"they" comes after
*"in" comes before, as a feature for indicating "not an institution", as it is likely a place.
*"near", "at" comes before or after, as a feature for indicating "not an institution", as it is likely a place.
*"is" comes after.
*"according to" comes before or after
*"officials" comes after (Immediately or two to three places after)
*"members of" comes before
*"member", "director", "chief", "sources", "agent", "chairman" or other similar person designations comes directly after entity.\
*"reported", "notes", "reviewed" and similar words comes after (But not "said", as these are people)
*"by" comes before (This may cause some issues though, as it could be cause names of people to occur)
*"named", "entity"
*"group", "organization", "society", "founded", "formed", "foundation", "community" in or nearby
*".org", ".com", ".co", "ltd", "partners", "company", "project", "corporation", "website", "nonprofit" before or after.
*Capital letters, and number of capital letters
*Not a city, state, or country
*Frequency of occurrence, or sub-word occurence in document. ("FBI National Security Branch" contains "FBI"
*Length of the entity.
*Verb occurs after the entity (Maybe we would be allowed to use open NLTK for this, or use a verb dictionary?)
*Probability of word occurring before or after unknown entity string, given training set 
probabilities. (Multinomial distribution, or counts)

** Post-processing rules. If any entity was labeled as positive, find all other occurrences of the
entity in the file, and mark as positive. BE CAREFUL, THIS MAY DRASTICALLY REDUCE PRECISION.
** Keep a learned dictionary of entities learned from the training set.
