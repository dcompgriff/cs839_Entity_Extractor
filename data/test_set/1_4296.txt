A
strong
earthquake
struck
Japan
on
Nov
.
21
,
2016
,
at
about
20:59
UTC
,
also
causing
the
issuance
of
a
tsunami
alert
.
The
<[>United
States
Geological
Survey<]>
has
reported
that
a
magnitude
6
.
9
quake
,
originally
reported
as
a
level
7
.
3
tremor
,
struck
near
Honshu
.
This
is
on
the
country’s
east
coast
.
The
seismic
activity
was
geographically
located
at
37
.
392
north
latitude
and
141
.
404
east
longitude
.
This
quake
was
near
Fukushima
region
and
arose
from
about
six
miles
deep
in
the
earth
.
The
closest
area
was
the
city
of
Namie
,
about
150
miles
northeast
of
Tokyo
.
The
location
of
the
strong
earthquake
that
rocked
Japan
caused
a
tsunami
alert
to
be
issued
.
Namie
lies
almost
directly
on
the
Pacific
coast
.
Initial
reports
about
the
strong
earthquake
that
rocked
Japan
and
caused
the
tsunami
alert
have
not
been
accompanied
by
reports
of
casualties
,
although
reports
may
be
scarce
.
At
the
time
of
publication
,
no
further
information
was
available
.
Earthquakes
are
generalized
as
minor
to
great
.
Any
tremor
of
a
magnitude
between
6
.
0
and
6
.
9
is
considered
strong
and
capable
of
doing
much
damage
in
populated
areas
.
Despite
the
quake
severity
,
scientific
estimates
reveal
about
100
of
these
occurring
each
year
throughout
the
world
.
The
movement
of
the
earth
can
create
a
tsunami
or
tidal
wave
.
The
<[>National
Weather
Service
Pacific
Tsunami
Warning
Center<]>
in
Hawaii
issued
the
alert
.
Estimates
are
that
waves
could
reach
up
to
one
meter
above
tide
level
.
Uncertainties
exist
in
providing
a
more
accurate
forecast
because
of
local
weather
situations
and
oceanic
conditions
that
cannot
be
adequately
accounted
for
,
such
as
reefs
and
atolls
.
