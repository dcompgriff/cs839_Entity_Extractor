‘I
Could
Sue
You’:
Trump’s
Spokeswoman
Slanders
Angela
Rye
On
<[>Live
TV<]>
–
Gets
Epic
Smack
Down
(
VIDEO
)



Over
the
past
few
months
,
the
on
-
air
battles
at
<[>CNN<]>
between
Trump’s
dumb
-
as
-
a
-
stump
surrogate
Katrina
Pierson
and
liberal
commentator
Angela
Rye
have
become
legendary
.
On
Friday
morning
the
two
put
on
the
gloves
to
go
another
round
.

The
conversation
starts
out
innocently
enough
,
with
a
discussion
about
new
economic
numbers
that
show
the
economy
is
growing
and
getting
stronger
.
Great
news
for
Americans
—
except
those
like
Donald
Trump
,
who
are
looking
to
benefit
politically
from
the
lie
that
record
numbers
of
people
are
suffering
.
Then
host
Carol
Costello
plays
a
clip
of
Trump
telling
an
Ohio
rally
that
he
wants
to
do
something
about
the
inner
city
“ghettos
.
”
She
observes
to
Pierson
that
many
black
Americans
would
observe
that
Trump
is
not
looking
at
“the
whole
of
the
black
population
.
”

Pierson
responds
that
some
members
of
the
black
community
have
been
consulting
with
Trump
about
the
problem
.
The
look
on
Rye’s
face
when
she
says
that
is
classic
.
When
she
gets
a
chance
to
respond
,
she
says
,

“I
think
it’s
really
important
that
when
we
have
conversations
like
this
they’re
rooted
in
facts
.
Let’s
talk
about
what
Donald
Trump
could
be
saying
to
black
people
that
would
resonate
and
be
based
in
truth
.
”

Rye
goes
on
to
explain
how
people
like
Trump
,
who
have
access
to
capital
,
don’t
seem
to
appreciate
that
everyone
can’t
get
their
hands
on
money
to
improve
their
lives
.
Then
she
talks
about
Trump’s
history
as
a
real
estate
mogul
,
who
has
actually
contributed
to
the
creation
of
the
“ghettos”
which
he
now
says
he
wants
to
fix
.

Pierson
responds
that
Trump
has
worked
with
members
of
the
black
community
,
including
Jesse
Jackson
,
to
help
members
of
the
black
community
create
and
build
businesses
.
That
promotes
a
hearty
laugh
from
Rye
.
Costello
notes
that
Rye
was
a
former
director
of
the
<[>Congressional
Black
Caucus<]>
,
as
she
asks
her
to
respond
.
Pierson
cuts
in
,
remarking
“And
[
she
]
ran
it
[
the
<[>CBC<]>
]
into
the
ground
.
”
At
that
point
,
the
two
women
drop
all
pretense
of
liking
each
other
and
the
battle
is
on
.
Rye
unloads
on
Pierson
with
a
barrage
of
facts
that
her
poor
little
Trump
-
addled
brain
was
probably
having
difficulty
processing
.
And
when
Costello
tries
to
rein
her
in
,
Rye
hits
Pierson
with
a
comment
right
out
of
Trump’s
playbook
.
Referring
to
the
charge
she
“ran
the
<[>CBC<]>
into
the
ground
,
”
Rye
says:

“That’s
slander
.
I
could
sue
you
,
Katrina
!
”

Here’s
the
latest
round
in
the
Rye

war
