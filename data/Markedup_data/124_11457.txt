<[>FBI<]>
Director
James
Comey’s
announcement
that
the


email
would
continue
in
light
of
new
information
.
Going
to
be
fun
watching
people
who
said
"
rigging
"
talk
was
an
attack
on
our
democracy
now
attack
the
integrity
of
the
<[>FBI<]>

As
we
reported
earlier
,
Paul
Krugman
was
among
the
lefties
who
thought
the
<[>FBI<]>
director’s
decision
and
how
it
was
handled
was
“
shameful
.
”
Krugman
also
added
this
:
If
we
don't
hear
more
from
Comey
,
we
just
have
to
conclude
that
he
was
trying
to
swing
election
.
And
*
that
*
should
be
the
story
.
