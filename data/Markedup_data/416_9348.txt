From
our
good
friends
Melissa
and
Aaron
Dykes
of
TruthStreamMedia
.
com
comes
a
documentary
unlike
anything
you’ve
seen
before
.
The
world
is
about
to
change
drastically
.
Will
you
be
ready
for
it
?
The
Future
Doesn’t
Need
Us…
Or
So
We’ve
Been
Told
.
With
the
rise
of
technology
and
the
real
-
time
pressures
of
an
online
,
global
economy
,
humans
will
have
to
be
very
clever
–
and
very
careful
–
not
to
be
left
behind
by
the
future
.
From
the
perspective
of
those
in
charge
,
human
labor
is
losing
its
value
,
and
people
are
becoming
a
liability
.
This
documentary
reveals
the
real
motivation
behind
the
secretive
effort
to
reduce
the
population
and
bring
resource
use
into
strict
,
centralized
control
.
Could
it
be
that
the
biggest
threat
we
face
isn’t
just
automation
and
robots
destroying
jobs
,
but
the
larger
sense
that
humans
could
become
obsolete
altogether
?
