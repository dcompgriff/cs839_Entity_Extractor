“
Syria’s
children
,
like
children
anywhere
else
in
the
world
,
deserve
the
chance
to
learn
and
play
without
running
the
risk
of
being
killed
in
their
classrooms
.

Twenty
-
two
children
and
six
teachers
were
killed
after
a
school
in
Idlib
,
Syria
was
bombed
on
Wednesday
,
which
aid
groups
are
saying
may
be
the
deadliest
attack
on
a
school
since
the
conflict
began
.
“
This
is
a
tragedy
.
It
is
an
outrage
.
And
if
deliberate
,
it
is
a
war
crime
,
”
said
Anthony
Lake
,
executive
director
of
the
<[>United
Nations
children’s
agency
UNICEF<]>
,
of
the
attack
on
the
school
compound
.
“
This
latest
atrocity
may
be
the
deadliest
attack
on
a
school
since
the
war
began
more
than
five
years
ago
,
”
he
continued
.
“
Children
lost
forever
to
their
families…teachers
lost
forever
to
their
students…one
more
scar
on
Syria’s
future
.

According
to
<[>BBC<]>
:
The
attack
on
Haas
,
about
75km
(
46
miles
)
south
-
west
of
Aleppo
,
appears
to
have
been
intense
and
flattened
a
number
of
buildings
,
reports
the
<[>BBC’s<]>
James
Longman
in
Beirut
.
Children
were
reportedly
gathered
around
an
entrance
when
it
was
hit
,
at
about
11:30
local
time
(
08:30
GMT
)
.
They
had
been
allowed
to
leave
classes
early
because
of
the
raids
elsewhere
in
the
village
.
Activists
shared
photographs
of
dead
bodies—many
of
them
children—on
the
floor
of
a
makeshift
treatment
center
.
Many
are
saying
that
Wednesday’s
bombing
is
evidence
of
the
increasing
human
suffering
caused
by
the
intractable
war
within
Syria
.
