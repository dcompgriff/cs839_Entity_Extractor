AS
THE
wave
of
euphoria
and
protests
which
greeted
his
election
victory
have
died
down
,
Donald
Trump
gave
consideration
for
the
first
time
to
what
the
actual
jobs
,
tasks
and
responsibilities
a
president
had
.

Crouched
out
of
the
view
of
his
family
and
campaign
staff
,
Trump
began
searching
various
Wikipedia
entries
in
a
bid
to
find
out
just
what
he
is
expected
to
do
come
his
inauguration
January
20th
.

Reading
that
his
inauguration
was
pencilled
in
for
the
end
of
January
,
the
president
-
elect
then
began
googling
once
more
in
an
effort
to
pin
down
what
exactly
an
inauguration
is
.

“Shit
,
”
Trump
muttered
under
his
breath
after
realising
the
job
extended
beyond
repeating
the
phrase
Make
America
Great
Again
for
4
years
straight
.
Trump
was
then
further
frustrated
when
a
search
for
‘wet
T
-
shirt
competitions
–
White
House
law’
returned
no
results
.

It
is
believed
current
US
President
Barack
Obama
met
with
Trump
yesterday
to
discuss
the
transition
of
power
between
the
two
,
in
a
meeting
that
should
have
lasted
10
minutes
.

“Barack
kept
mentioning
things
like
‘policies’
and
‘responsibilities
and
specific
terms
relating
to
governance
,
but
Trump
simply
spent
the
next
90
minutes
repeatedly
asking
‘yes
,
but
what
does
a
president
do
?
'”
explained
a
White
House
aide
,
privy
to
their
conversation
.
