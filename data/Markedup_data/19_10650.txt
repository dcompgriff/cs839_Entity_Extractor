certain
powers
have
a
vested
interest

our
real

Because
a
great
deal
has
been
unearthed
which
is
completely
at
odds
with
conventional
notions
regarding
the
origins
of
what
we
know
today
as

Windsors
and
the

delberately
ignoring

web
hosts

threatened
with
legal
action
after
lawyers
representing
none
other
than
Dov
Zakheim
himself
claimed
this
article
was

was
not
fully
removed
so
read
it
before
Zakheim
gets
us
shut
down
