Computer
seized
in
Weiner
probe
prompts
<[>FBI<]>
to
take
new
steps
in
Clinton
email
inquiry
<[>Washington
Post<]>

Read
the
letter
Comey
sent
to
<[>FBI<]>
employees
explaining
his
controversial
decision
on
the
Clinton
email
investigation
<[>Washington
Post<]>
.
Consistent
with
my
pet
theory
that
Comey
was
force
to
get
out
in
front
of
this
development
due
to
the
odds
of
staff
insurrection
in
the
form
of
leaks
.
From
Lambert
via
e
-
mail
:

By
Comey’s
own
words
under
oath
in
July
,
there
must
have
been
“
new
and
substantial
information
.
”
So
unless
Comey
is
committing
perjury
,
which
the
Clinton
campaign
has
not
,
so
far
,
claimed
,
this
is
not
a
nothingburger
,
by
definition
.

So
that
must
have
been
quite
some
“
briefing
.
”

Also
:
“
Yesterday
,
the
investigative
team
briefed
me
on
their
recommendation
with
respect
to
seeking
access
to
emails
that
have
recently
been
found
in
an
unrelated
case
.
Because
those
emails
appear
to
be
pertinent
to
our
investigation
,
I
agreed
that
we
should
take
appropriate
steps
to
obtain
and
review
them
.
”

So
there’s
a
process
,
it
doubtless
takes
more
than
a
week
,
and
therefore
the
Clinton
campaign’s
talking
point
of
“
We
don’t
know
what’s
there
,
so
release
it
all
for
the
sake
of
the
American
people
”
is
bullshit
,
even
if
you
leave
out
that
the
emails
can’t
be
released
without
vetting
them
for
classified
information
.

Also
,
if
it’s
really
nasty
,
do
the
people
the
Democrats
encouraged
to
vote
early
get
a
Mulligan
?

Clinton
urges
<[>FBI<]>
to
explain
renewed
email
inquiry
‘
without
delay
<[>Washington
Post<]>
.
As
if
the
<[>FBI<]>
has
to
explain
itself
to
her
?

Democrats
turn
on
Comey
after
he
reopens
Clinton
email
wound
<[>Politico<]>
.
How
fickle
of
them
.
He
was
their
statesman
just
a
few
weeks
ago…My
guess
is
that
Comey
told
<[>Congress<]>
because
so
many
agents
in
the
<[>FBI<]>
were
unhappy
about
how
the
earlier
probe
had
been
handled
and
the
the
news
of
the
latest
batch
of
e
-
mails
was
already
all
over
the
<[>FIB<]>
(
a
Freudian
typo
)
.
Thus
Comey
felt
he
had
to
go
public
,
since
it
would
otherwise
be
leaked
and
he
judged
that
to
be
worse
(
imagine
the
wrath
of
the
Republican
Congresscritters
)
