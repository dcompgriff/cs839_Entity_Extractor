For
all
the
mainstream
media
driven
commenters
and
constitutionally
illiterate
people
who
have
been
badmouthing
the
Bundys
and
their
stand
at
the
Oregon
Malheur
Wildlife
Reserve
,
both
Bundy
brothers
,
along
with
five
others
,
have
been
found
not
guilty
on
all
charges
.

The
Associated
Press
reports
:

PORTLAND
,
Ore
.
(
AP
)
-
A
federal
jury
has
found
Ammon
Bundy
and
his
six
co
-
defendants
not
guilty
on
all
charges
for
taking
over
a
federal
wildlife
refuge
in
eastern
Oregon
earlier
this
year
.

…

Led
by
Bundy
,
the
defendants
were
part
of
a
group
that
occupied
the
Malheur
National
Wildlife
Refuge
last
winter
.
They
were
charged
with
conspiring
to
impede
Interior
Department
employees
from
doing
their
jobs
,
through
force
,
threat
or
intimidation
.

The
defendants
said
they
were
engaging
in
a
peaceful
protest
,
pressing
their
case
against
federal
control
of
Western
lands
and
the
imprisonment
of
two
ranchers
convicted
of
setting
fires
.

The
jury
was
also
deciding
whether
four
of
them
are
guilty
of
possessing
a
firearm
in
a
federal
facility
.
Two
defendants
,
Ryan
Bundy
and
Kenneth
Medenbach
,
were
charged
with
theft
of
government
property
.

One
juror
was
dismissed
during
deliberations
and
an
alternate
was
brought
in
.
The
jury
was
in
its
fourth
day
of
deliberations
when
Judge
Anna
Brown
asked
them
for
a
verdict
.

"
A
very
quick
verdict
almost
always
means
a
verdict
for
the
government
,
"
said
Medenbach's
attorney
,
Matthew
Schindler
.

"
The
level
of
deliberation
that's
been
undertaken
in
this
case
means
we
have
jurors
who
are
very
interested
in
applying
the
burden
of
proof
and
making
sure
a
complicated
allegation
of
conspiracy
has
actually
been
proved
in
this
case
.
It's
not
as
simple
as
showing
that
people
were
at
the
refuge
.
"

Marcus
Mumford
,
Ammon
Bundy's
attorney
was
taken
into
custody
by
US
Marshals
following
his
repeated
claim
that
his
client
was
free
to
go
.
Several
people
claimed
he
was
tased
,
while
others
alleged
he
was
tackled
.
