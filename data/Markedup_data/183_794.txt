Christopher
Ashton
Kutcher
is
a
well
-
known
figure
in
the
American
entertainment
industry
.
Apart
from
acting
,
Kutcher
is
also
an
investor
.
A
venture
capitalist
,
Kutcher
has
successfully
invested
in
several
high
technology
startups
with
some
of
his
investments
including
<[>Skype<]>
,
<[>Foursquare<]>
,
<[>Airbnb<]>
,
<[>Path<]>
and
<[>Fab
.
com<]>
.
But
despite
being
a
businessman
and
a
public
figure
,
societal
problems
are
dear
to
his
heart
.
In
2008
,
Kutcher
and
his
ex
-
wife
,
Demi
Moore
decided
to
tackle
one
of
the
more
serious
crimes
facing
our
modern
world
–
human/sex
trafficking
.
By
basic
definition
,
human
trafficking
is
the
trade
of
humans
,
most
commonly
for
the
purpose
of
sexual
slavery
,
forced
labor
or
commercial
sexual
exploitation
.
The
trade
is
a
modern
form
of
slavery
.
It
involves
controlling
a
person
through
force
,
fraud
,
or
coercion
to
exploit
the
victim
.
Over
the
years
,
the
<[>United
Nations<]>
,
International
Non
-
Governmental
Organizations
,
human
rights
activists
,
and
individuals
have
all
stepped
up
efforts
in
order
to
end
the
trade
.
However
,
due
to
the
high
rate
of
unemployment
and
rising
poverty
levels
in
some
nations
,
the
trade
is
still
secretly
thriving
.
Also
,
with
the
rise
of
the
internet
and
technology
,
it
is
becoming
increasingly
easy
for
traffickers
to
lure
people
,
especially
young
girls
,
into
the
dirty
business
.
Mostly
,
traffickers
will
hide
on
the
deep
web
,
using
sophisticated
gadgets
to
carry
out
their
trade
.
Kutcher
and
Moore
decided
to
concentrate
their
efforts
on
the
Internet
,
to
thwart
the
trade
of
the
traffickers
.
They
set
up
an
organization
called
<[>Thorn<]>
.
<[>Thorn’s<]>
mission
is
very
simple
:
to
eliminate
sex
-
trafficking
and
child
exploitation
over
the
Internet
.
With
the
help
of
around
20
technology
companies
,
they
set
up
the
<[>Thorn
Task
Technical
Force<]>
.
Technology
companies
such
as
<[>Facebook<]>
,
<[>Google<]>
,
<[>Twitter<]>
,
<[>Yahoo<]>
!
,
<[>Snapchat<]>
and
<[>Imgur<]>
are
all
part
of
this
task
force
.
They
dedicate
their
time
and
resources
to
searching
the
darker
corners
of
the
Internet
,
hunting
out
traffickers
who
have
been
involving
in
trafficking
innocent
people
.
Since
establishing
Thorn
in
2008
,
the
organization
has
so
far
,
identified
and
rescued
over
6
,
000
trafficking
victims
and
captured
over
2
,
000
traffickers
–
many
of
which
are
now
in
the
process
of
facing
criminal
charges
.
