NORTHAMPTONSHIRE
–
England
–
A
song
released
by
former
Conservative
MP
Michael
Heseltine
aka
Tarzan
,
has
shot
into
the
UK
charts
at
number
2
.



Released
by
the
83
year
old
former
MP’s
own
record
label
Ungawa
Records
,
the
song
is
simply
about
strangling
his
dog
.

“Who
snuffed
the
dogs
out
?
Who
snuffed
the
dogs
out
?
Hezza
!
Hezza
!
Hezza
!
”
a
sample
of
some
of
the
lyrics
which
go
on
a
permanent
loop
for
three
and
a
half
minutes
include
a
soundbite
from
Margaret
Thatcher
saying
“Get
orf
my
neck
!
”

The
eighties
drum
machine
sound
is
very
retro
,
and
also
the
very
realistic
sound
of
a
gurgling
dog
in
the
background
while
Heseltine
conducts
an
almighty
Tarzan
wail
makes
for
interesting
listening
.

All
proceeds
of
the
record
will
not
go
to
the
RSPCA
but
will
instead
be
funnelled
into
Heseltine’s
latest
acquisition
,
a
duck
house
in
his
large
pond
,
so
he
can
shoot
the
shit
out
of
the
ducks
when
they’re
trying
to
nest
.
