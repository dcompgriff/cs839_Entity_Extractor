This
blog
comes
from
Johannesburg
,
South
Africa
,
where
investigative
journalists
from
28
countries
are
sharing
their
work
at
the
African
Investigative
Journalism
Conference
.
One
session
looked
at
stories
dug
out
from
the
Panama
Papers
leak
from
offshore
law
firm
Mossack
Fonseca
and
investigations
which
have
revealed
a
colourful
mix
of
characters
involved
in
looting
Africa
.

The
stories
uncovered
include
a
mafia
lawyer
linked
to
the
film
The
French
Connection
,
an
absentee
landowning
Russian
oligarch
,
plus
,
of
course
,
a
former
politician
,
and
a
“millionaire
receptionist”
who
denies
knowledge
of
having
owned
nine
offshore
companies
registered
in
the
British
Virgin
Islands
.

The
common
factor
in
all
these
stories
is
the
role
of
offshore
secrecy
jurisdictions
populated
by
western
banks
,
western
lawyers
,
western
accounting
firms
,
and
protected
by
leading
western
nations
like
the
United
Kingdom
,
which
even
as
I
write
is
vigorously
trying
to
protect
its
Crown
Dependencies
from
attempts
to
crack
down
on
offshore
secrecy
.

Unsurprisingly
the
British
Virgin
Islands
–
a
British
overseas
territory
–
feature
heavily
,
as
does
Switzerland
.

The
story
of
the
“millionaire
receptionist”
Letitia
Diergaardt
,
covered
by
The
Namibian
newspaper
,
provides
fascinating
insights
into
the
duplicity
of
offshore
secrecy
.
Diergaardt
works
as
a
receptionist/clerk
in
Windhoek
,
Namibia
.
Yet
according
to
The
Namibian
she
technically
owns
or
owned
nine
offshore
companies
registered
in
the
British
Virgin
Islands
.
However
,
as
The
Namibian
reports
,
she
denies
all
knowledge
of
owning
these
companies
,
which
were
registered
in
the
BVI
between
13th
and
25th
April
2007
.

Apparently
unknown
to
her
,
Diergaardt’s
identity
was
used
to
provide
a
nominee
shareholder
for
all
nine
companies
.
As
The
Namibian
dryly
notes:
“on
face
value
,
the
use
of
her
name
in
these
companies
is
to
represent
hidden
owners
.
.
“

Secretive
shell
companies
are
a
core
part
of
the
secrecy
jurisdiction
offer
.
They
provide
immunity
from
criminal
investigation
and
prosecution
.
They
are
the
‘get
-
out
-
of
-
jail
-
free’
card
for
crooks
and
their
enablers
.
Secretive
shell
companies
allow
nominee
owners
to
front
for
those
known
as
the
‘ultimate
beneficial
owners’
,
as
The
Namibian
comments:

“The
secretive
offshore
industry
relies
on
a
network
of
individuals
whose
names
are
used
on
official
records
as
directors
,
company
secretaries
and
shareholders
.
Often
,
the
real
owners
who
call
the
shots
remain
invisible
,
hiding
behind
dummy
directors
,
who
are
only
owners
of
these
companies
on
paper
.
”

Yet
despite
all
the
evidence
of
abuse
of
offshore
companies
registered
in
Road
Town
,
the
British
Virgin
Islands
government
persists
in
blocking
moves
to
make
a
registry
of
ultimate
beneficial
ownership
available
to
public
scrutiny
.
In
Jersey
,
another
British
tax
haven
,
the
authorities
refuse
to
make
company
ownership
information
available
to
investigative
journalists
by
claiming
that
a
public
registry
would
“lead
to
fraud
and
cybercrime
.
”

Let’s
be
frank
.
For
all
their
pious
words
about
wanting
to
crack
down
on
corrupt
practices
,
western
governments
remain
deeply
implicated
in
facilitating
the
looting
of
Africa
.

As
Shinovene
Immanuel
from
The
Namibian
told
this
blogger
earlier
today:

“The
West
must
help
Africa
by
locking
the
doors
through
which
the
money
flows
,
and
the
West
must
also
pull
up
their
socks
to
make
these
offshore
companies
more
transparent
.
If
Western
countries
want
to
help
developing
countries
,
they
must
stop
standing
in
the
way
of
investigating
corrupt
business
practices
.
