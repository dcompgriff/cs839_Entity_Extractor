The
primary
way
in
which
your
body
expels
toxins
is
via
the
liver
,
which
detoxifies
and
cleanses
your
body
by
continuously
filtering
the
blood
of
poisons
that
enter
it
through
the
digestive
tract
,
the
skin
,
and
the
respiratory
system
.
But
when
your
liver
becomes
overworked
as
a
result
of
stress
or
excessive
exposure
to
toxins
,
your
entire
system
can
be
thrown
off
balance
,
and
your
health
severely
compromised
.

Since
the
liver
is
also
responsible
for
producing
bile
,
another
form
of
detoxification
that
is
metabolically
necessary
for
the
breakdown
and
assimilation
of
fats
and
proteins
from
your
food
,
it
is
exceedingly
important
that
your
liver
be
properly
maintained
.
Without
a
well
-
functioning
liver
,
your
body
will
be
unable
to
cleanse
itself
and
absorb
nutrients
,
which
is
a
recipe
for
a
health
disaster
.

“
The
thousands
of
enzyme
systems
that
are
responsible
for
virtually
every
body
activity
are
constructed
in
the
liver
,
”
writes
Dr
.
Karl
Maret
,
M
.
D
.
,
about
the
importance
of
vibrant
liver
function
.
“
The
proper
functioning
of
the
eyes
,
the
heart
,
the
brain
,
the
gonads
,
the
joints
,
and
the
kidneys
,
are
all
dependent
on
good
liver
activity
.
”

“
If
the
liver
is
impaired
from
constructing
even
one
of
the
thousands
of
enzyme
systems
the
body
requires
,
there
is
an
impairment
in
overall
body
function
and
a
resultant
greater
metabolic
stress
on
the
individual
.
”

So
here
are
seven
important
foods
you
may
want
to
begin
incorporating
into
your
diet
in
order
to
maintain
a
healthy
liver
.


Garlic
,
grapefruit
,
green
tea
,
and
green
vegetables
Garlic
contains
numerous
sulfur
-
containing
compounds
that
activate
the
liver
enzymes
responsible
for
flushing
out
toxins
from
the
body
.
This
bulbous
relative
of
the
onion
also
contains
allicin
and
selenium
,
two
powerful
nutrients
proven
to
help
protect
the
liver
from
toxic
damage
,
and
aid
it
in
the
detoxification
process
.

Grapefruit
is
rich
in
natural
vitamin
C
and
antioxidants
,
two
powerful
liver
cleansers
.
Like
garlic
,
grapefruit
contains
compounds
that
boost
the
production
of
liver
detoxification
enzymes
.
It
also
contains
a
flavonoid
compound
known
as
naringenin
that
causes
the
liver
to
burn
fat
rather
than
store
it

.

Green
tea
is
loaded
with
catechins
,
a
type
of
plant
antioxidant
that
has
been
shown
in
studies
to
eliminate
liver
fat
accumulation
and
promote
proper
liver
function

.
This
powerful
herbal
beverage
also
protects
the
liver
against
toxins
that
would
otherwise
accumulate
and
cause
serious
damage
.

Leafy
green
vegetables
such
as
bitter
gourd
,
arugula
,
dandelion
greens
,
spinach
,
mustard
greens
,
and
chicory
also
contain
numerous
cleansing
compounds
that
neutralize
heavy
metals
,
which
can
bear
heavily
on
the
liver
.
Leafy
greens
also
eliminate
pesticides
and
herbicides
from
the
body
,
and
spur
the
creation
and
flow
of
cleansing
bile
.


Avocados
,
walnuts
,
and
turmeric
Rich
in
glutathione
-
producing
compounds
,
avocados
actively
promote
liver
health
by
protecting
it
against
toxic
overload
,
and
boosting
its
cleansing
power

.
Some
research
has
shown
that
eating
one
or
two
avocados
a
week
for
as
little
as
30
days
can
repair
a
damaged
liver
.

Walnuts
,
which
contain
high
levels
of
l
-
arginine
,
an
amino
acid
,
glutathione
,
and
omega
-
3
fatty
acids
,
also
help
detoxify
the
liver
of
disease
-
causing
ammonia
.
Walnuts
also
help
oxygenate
the
blood
,
and
extracts
from
their
hulls
are
often
used
in
liver
-
cleansing
formulas
.

Turmeric
,
one
of
the
most
powerful
foods
for
maintaining
a
healthy
liver
,
has
been
shown
to
actively
protect
the
liver
against
toxic
damage
,
and
even
regenerate
damaged
liver
cells
.
Turmeric
also
boosts
the
natural
production
of
bile
,
shrinks
engorged
hepatic
ducts
,
and
improves
overall
function
of
the
gallbladder
,
another
body
-
purifying
organ
.
