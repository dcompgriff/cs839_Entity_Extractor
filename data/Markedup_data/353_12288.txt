THE
scramble
for
tickets
to
the
2018
World
Cup
final
is
well
underway
as
FIFA
report
unprecedented
interest
from
Irish
football
fans
,
WWN
has
learned
.

With
a
James
McClean
goal
securing
a
historic
win
in
Vienna
for
the
boys
in
green
,
Ireland
sits
top
of
their
qualifying
group
after
4
games
,
all
but
guaranteeing
a
showdown
against
Brazil
in
the
final
just
under
two
years
from
now
.

“I’ve
a
brother
in
the
FAI
,
and
even
he
can’t
get
me
tickets
.
I’m
proper
panicking
now
,
what
if
I
can’t
get
one
?

worried
Irish
supporter

WWN

Ireland’s
path
to
Russia
2018
and
their
subsequent
run
to
the
final
has
come
courtesy
of
a
good
performance
against
an
anemic
Austria
side
on
Saturday
,
and
fans
are
becoming
increasingly
desperate
to
ensure
they
don’t
miss
out
on
the
biggest
game
in
Irish
soccer
history
.

“I’ve
been
online
since
the
win
,
just
checking
to
see
if
anyone
is
selling
a
spare
ticket
.
I’m
prepared
to
blow
the
life
savings
on
this
.
There’s
no
way
I’m
missing
us
lifting
the
World
Cup
trophy
,
”
shared
Dubliner
Tommy
Gleeson
,
whose
budget
for
a
ticket
stands
at
an
eye
watering
€120
.

In
a
bid
to
quell
the
overzealous
reaction
to
the
recent
win
,
the
FAI
delivered
a
sobering
statement
this
morning
.

“Lads
,
Jesus
,
relax
will
ye
.
Listen
,
when
FIFA
post
us
over
our
ticket
allocation
for
the
final
,
you
lot
will
be
the
first
to
know
.
A
bit
of
patience
please
,
