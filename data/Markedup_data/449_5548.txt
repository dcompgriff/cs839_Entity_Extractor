With
the
Thanksgiving
Day
holiday
on
Thursday
of
this
week
,
are
you
prepared
for
the
unwinding
of
the
biggest
bubble
in
history
?

Here
is
a
portion
of
what
Peter
Boockvar
wrote
today
as
the
world
awaits
the
next
round
of
monetary
madness:
I
want
to
start
the
week
by
saying
I
believe
‘secular
stagnation’
is
bulls
*
*t
.
As
a
believer
in
free
trade
and
comparative
advantage
and
thus
with
hopes
that
no
trade
battles
take
place
in
the
next
4
years
,
I
want
to
reiterate
my
optimism
over
the
potential
liberation
of
the
US
economy
via
lower
and
more
competitive
tax
rates
and
an
easing
of
the
regulatory
strait
jacket
all
around
the
economy
.
This
said
,
before
we
get
to
that
economically
better
place
(
which
we
no
doubt
will
I
believe
)
I
can’t
help
but
be
on
alert
about
what
the
implications
are
of
an
unwinding
of
the
biggest
bubble
ever
created
,
that
of
credit
via
the
helping
hands
of
our
central
bankers…

As
a
reminder
,
back
in
October
the
IMF
quantified
the
extent
of
this
credit
bubble
by
saying
that
global
debt
reached
$
152
Trillion
in
2015
or
225
%
of
world
GDP
(
see
attached
chart
)
,
a
record
high
.
They
said
“about
two
thirds
of
this
debt
consists
of
liabilities
of
the
private
sector
.
”
Thus
,
simply
stated
,
this
is
the
context
that
a
rise
in
global
interest
rates
comes
in
.
The
caveat
on
this
debt
build
up
though
is
stated
by
the
IMF
,
“there
is
no
consensus
about
how
much
is
too
much
.

According
to
SIFMA
(
Securities
Industry
and
Financial
Markets
Association
)
,
US
bond
market
debt
of
which
will
be
impacted
by
the
rise
in
rates
totaled
$
40
.
7T
at
the
end
of
Q2
(
a
similar
ratio
to
GDP
as
the
world
ratio
)
.
This
debt
consists
of
Treasury
,
municipal
,
mortgage
related
,
corporate
debt
,
federal
agency
securities
,
money
markets
,
and
asset
backed
.

Higher
Interest
Rates
To
Impact
Key
Markets
Direct
to
consumer
,
higher
rates
will
of
course
influence
auto’s
and
housing
(
negatively
on
the
cost
of
funding
a
home
purchase
but
positively
for
first
time
buyers
where
hopefully
higher
rates
slows
down
the
persistent
5
%
+
rate
of
home
price
gains
)
.

Corporate
earnings
will
be
helped
by
faster
revenue
growth
in
coming
years
from
lower
tax
rates
and
reduced
regulations
but
the
lever
of
lowered
interest
expense
,
likely
a
slowdown
in
debt
driven
stock
buybacks
,
multiple
compression
and
the
negative
impact
of
a
higher
cost
of
capital
for
both
businesses
and
individuals
will
be
an
offset
.

Bottom
Line
Bottom
line
,
central
banks
have
been
suppressing
the
beach
ball
under
water
for
nearly
10
years
and
that
ball
finally
saw
some
air
.
In
particular
,
a
gradual
rise
in
rates
is
the
choice
of
the
Fed
stated
a
multitude
of
times
but
gradual
is
of
course
not
what
we’ve
seen
from
the
market
.
In
a
world
of
epic
debt
levels
,
it
would
be
naïve
not
to
worry
about
the
end
of
the
35
year
bull
market
in
bonds
irrespective
of
the
economic
positives
that
a
Trump
presidency
will
bring
.
