North
Dakota
water
protector
Redhawk
reported
today
at
Standing
Rock
that
two
police
officers
just
turned
in
their
badges
to
show
their
support
for
the
water
protectors
.

“There
have
been
at
least
2
reports
of
police
officers
turning
in
their
badges
acknowledging
that
this
battle
is
not
what
they
signed
up
for
,
”

While
most
of
the
police
officers
at
the
scene
of
the
DAPL
protests
have
been
brutal
,
violent
,
and
unconstitutionally
-
militarized
,
it
is
clear
from
this
recent
act
of
solidarity
that
some
of
their
hearts
can
be
turned
to
the
cause
of
justice
.

This
recent
incident
is
reminiscent
of
what
happened
in
Frankfurt
,
Germany
in
May
of
2012
,
when
police
removed
their
helmets
and
began
marching
with
the
people
protesting
big
banks
.

According
to
the
Washington
Post
,
“At
least
20
,
000
people
held
a
major
rally
of
the
local
Occupy
movement
inFrankfurt
on
Saturday
to
decry
austerity
measures
affecting
much
of
Europe
,
the
dominance
of
banks
,
and
what
they
call
untamed
capitalism
.
”

Yesterday
,
Barack
Obama
announced
that
the
White
House
is
considering
“re
-
routing”
the
pipeline
to
honor
the
1851
Indian
Treaty
that
guarantees
the
land
in
question
to
the
Standing
Rock
Nation
