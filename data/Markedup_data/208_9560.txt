In
the
midst
of
deepening
tension
between
US
allies
<[>NATO<]>
and
Russia
,
<[>NATO<]>
is
planning
the
largest
military
buildup
along
the
Russian
border
since
the
cold
war
.
<[>NATO<]>
called
on
allied
governments
this
week
to
contribute
whatever
troops
and
equipment
they
can
to
the
effort
.
According
to
<[>Reuters<]>
,
thousands
of
troops
are
expected
to
arrive
in
the
coming
days
and
weeks
.
It
was
reported
that
Italy
,
France
,
Denmark
and
other
European
states
are
expected
to
join
the
<[>NATO<]>
military
divisions
that
will
be
led
by
the
United
States
along
Russia’s
border
.
On
Wednesday
,
Britain
announced
it
is
sending
hundreds
of
soldiers
and
hardware
to
Russia’s
borders
as
part
of
a
huge
military
deployment
.
A
total
of
800
troops
,
drones
and
tanks
are
moving
to
Estonia
as
part
of
the
biggest
military
build
-
up
of
<[>NATO<]>
troops
on
Russia’s
borders
since
the
Cold
War
.
In
addition
to
the
forces
allocated
for
his
specific
operation
,
<[>NATO<]>
has
an
army
of
over
40
,
000
ready
to
be
called
up
to
fight
at
any
time
.
The
<[>US
military<]>
claims
that
this
threatening
move
is
meant
to
act
as
a
“
deterrent
”
to
the
<[>Russian
military<]>
,
but
this
is
obvious
a
move
that
will
escalate
tensions
and
push
towards
a
possible
third
world
war
.
“
This
is
a
credible
deterrence
,
not
to
provoke
a
conflict
but
to
prevent
conflict
,
”
<[>NATO<]>
Secretary
-
General
Jens
Stoltenberg
said
on
Tuesday
—
ironically
ignoring
the
fact
that
it
is
a
de
facto
provocation
.
Just
imagine
what
would
happen
if
Russian
troops
amassed
along
the
Mexican
border
and
told
the
US
that
this
move
was
to
‘
prevent
conflict
.
’
The
so
-
called
Iskander
-
M
cruise
missiles
can
hit
targets
across
Poland
and
the
Baltics
,
although
<[>NATO<]>
officials
declined
to
say
if
Russia
had
moved
nuclear
warheads
to
Kaliningrad
.
The
United
States’
envoy
to
<[>NATO<]>
,
Douglas
Lute
,
told
reporters
that
<[>NATO<]>
and
the
<[>US
military<]>
may
consider
Russia
a
threat
if
they
had
nuclear
weapons
within
range
of
<[>NATO’s<]>
deployment
.
This
statement
is
insane
considering
the
fact
that
the
<[>US
military<]>
is
the
one
that
is
many
miles
from
home
on
the
border
of
someone
else’s
lands
.
“
This
deployment
,
if
it
becomes
permanent
if
the
presence
of
nuclear
weapons
were
confirmed
,
would
be
a
change
in
(
Russia’s
)
security
posture
,
”
Lute
said
.
If
anyone
is
a
threat
,
it
is
<[>NATO<]>
and
the
<[>US
government<]>
.
These
military
tensions
are
the
result
of
an
ongoing
proxy
war
in
Syria
,
in
which
Western
powers
are
attempting
to
institute
a
regime
change
in
the
country
by
funding
violent
rebel
groups
.
Meanwhile
,
Russia
has
interests
in
keeping
their
allies
in
the
<[>Syrian
government<]>
in
control
,
putting
the
two
superpowers
at
odds
.
Until
now
,
Russia
and
the
US
have
been
fighting
through
third
parties
,
just
as
they
had
during
the
previous
Cold
War
,
and
the
same
type
of
situation
is
developing
today
.
