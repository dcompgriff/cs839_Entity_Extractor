What
could
be
better
than
waking
up
in
time
to
witness
the
last
few
minutes
of
the
historic
race
between
the
Champion
of
Deplorables
and
the
Best
Friend
of
Banksters
,
and
to
see
Trump
emerging
victorious
!
Thank
you
,
Lord
,
for
allowing
me
to
see
these
scenes
at
all
and
especially
in
sunny
Jerusalem
where
I
am
now
,
and
thank
you
,
our
American
friends
,
for
achieving
this
victory
.
You
were
not
scared
when
they
called
you
“racist
rednecks”
,
you
did
not
despair
when
the
CNN
said
(
yesterday
)
that
Clinton
had
a
96
%
chance
of
winning
.
You
did
not
sat
down
with
a
bottle
of
beer
,
you
still
went
to
the
booths
and
voted
,
God
bless
you
.

And
thank
you
those
who
voted
against
Trump
.
Ex
-
Pres
.
Bush
said
he
did
not
vote
for
Trump
–
why
,
this
news
made
my
day
!
I
am
so
happy
that
we
do
not
owe
anything
,
not
a
single
vote
in
the
victory
,
to
the
warring
Bushmen
.
It
would
be
embarrassing
to
find
oneself
in
the
same
camp
as
the
Butcher
of
Iraq
.
John
McCain
tried
to
knife
Trump
,
didn’t
endorse
him
–
this
is
also
good
news
.
The
FBI
boss
submitted
to
pressure
and
supported
Clinton
instead
of
adhering
to
the
law:
good
riddance
!

God
bless
you
,
my
colleagues
and
editors
of
the
truly
great
independent
American
media
,
Ron
Unz
of
Unz
.

,
Jeffrey
St
Clair
of
Counterpunch
,
Justin
Raimondo
of
Antiwar
.
com
!
By
attacking
the
corrupted
mainstream
media
,
you
preserved
the
dignity
and
the
meaning
of
our
profession
,
you
delivered
analysis
and
opinions
to
the
thinking
working
men
of
America
.

God
bless
you
,
Julian
Assange
of
Wikileaks
,
in
the
windowless
room
in
the
Ecuadorian
embassy
in
London
!
You
did
so
much
by
publishing
the
documents
nobody
dared
to
touch
.
Without
you
,
the
American
people
would
not
know
of
the
evil
stratagems
in
the
DNC
,
of
the
Podesta
plots
.
You
unmasked
their
plans
.
These
discoveries
will
provide
much
material
to
tomorrow’s
media
.
Let
President
Donald
Trump
pardon
Julian
,
for
all
he
did
,
he
did
for
us
,
in
the
great
battle
against
the
evil
globalizers
.
And
while
he’s
at
it
,
let
him
pardon
Edward
Snowden
and
Bradley
Manning
,
let
them
go
home
in
honour
.

Today
,
mankind
has
avoided
a
great
danger
.
We
peered
into
the
abyss
of
Armageddon
and
quickly
moved
away
.
Now
the
world
can
fix
its
many
problems
.
The
Middle
East
wars
will
soon
be
over
.
With
defeat
of
the
Daesh
Queen
Hillary
,
the
fanatic
rebels
will
leave
Aleppo
for
their
bases
in
the
Arabian
desert
and
allow
Syrians
to
rebuild
their
beautiful
land
.
Let
Saudis
feed
and
house
the
ISIS
gangs
,
perhaps
they
will
be
useful
camel
riders
.
There
is
enough
space
in
Saudi
Arabia
for
all
the
jihadis
,
let
them
go
there
and
stay
there
.

Friendship
with
Russia
will
disarm
the
other
source
of
danger
,
Eastern
Europe
.
The
NATO
warmongers
will
retire
to
cultivate
cucumbers
.
Estonia
will
be
safe
,
actually
,
safer
without
American
tanks
.
The
world
does
not
need
so
many
weapons
of
mass
destruction
;
the
funds
can
be
spent
on
something
better
,
like
affordable
medical
care
for
the
average
Americans
.
Or
indeed
infrastructure
,
as
Trump
mentioned
.

Minority
politics
did
not
work
.
The
women
,
the
white
women
of
America
gave
their
votes
to
Trump
,
despite
being
ordered
to
march
with
the
sisterhood
of
Madeleine
Albright
.
US
citizens
of
Mexican
origin
knew
they
are
being
used
by
people
who
do
not
care
for
them:
and
they
did
not
bother
to
go
and
vote
for
Clinton
.

What
about
the
Jews
?
I’ll
surprise
you:
despite
many
dark
hints
to
the
contrary
,
Israelis
were
happy
with
Trump’s
victory
.
The
US
citizens
living
in
Israel
voted
for
Trump
.
Religious
Jews
(
in
Israel
and
in
the
US
)
voted
for
Trump
.
There
was
a
hysterical
scream
in
the
Jewish
liberal
camp
,
among
the
gay
parade
Jews
,
or
among
financial
Jews
,
but
this
is
a
small
though
voluble
part
of
Jewish
population
.

Indeed
Hillary
propaganda
warriors
claimed
that
all
the
Jews
support
Clinton
and
are
afraid
of
Trump
.
But
not
every
Jewish
woman
is
called
Janet
Yellen
;
not
every
Jewish
man
is
George
Soros
(
who
is
very
unpopular
in
Israel
)
or
the
CEO
of
Goldman
Sachs
,
Lloyd
Blankfein
.
Conservative
and
observant
Jews
did
not
like
the
push
against
gender
normalcy
that
seems
to
be
the
favorite
topic
for
Clinton
camp
.

Trump’s
idea
of
a
border
wall
is
already
a
success
in
Israel:
such
a
wall
has
been
built
between
Israel
and
Egypt’s
Sinai
.
Before
the
wall
was
built
,
tens
of
thousands
of
African
job
-
seekers
flooded
Israel
;
since
the
wall
has
been
completed
about
one
hundred
plucky
persons
made
it
.
The
liberals
in
Israel
demanded
to
provide
full
rights
to
the
refugees
from
Eritrea
and
Sudan
,
who
were
housed
in
the
poor
Jewish
neighborhoods
.
There
was
a
lot
of
aggravation
,
and
the
wall
solved
it
all
.

In
short
,
the
claim
for
“all
the
Jews”
has
been
as
false
as
the
claim
for
“all
the
women”
.
One
can
expect
that
the
Jews
will
produce
a
new
community
leadership
instead
of
the
old
one
that
had
been
tainted
with
hatred
to
working
class
whites
and
to
the
Christian
church
.
It
is
possible:
Jews
are
very
flexible
,
and
they
usually
know
the
difference
between
what
they
want
and
what
they
can
get
.

The
Palestinians
I
meet
these
days
in
Jerusalem
,
Bethlehem
and
Ramallah
do
not
regret
the
Fall
of
the
House
of
Clinton
.
They
have
gotten
nothing
from
the
Democratic
Presidents
.
They
were
obedient
to
AIPAC
and
quick
to
veto
every
pro
-
Palestinian
resolution
.
Is
there
a
possible
solution
for
the
Palestinian
-
Israeli
conflict
?
Yes
,
this
is
called
One
State
Solution
.
Let
Israel
absorb
all
Palestinian
territories
and
populations
,
give
them
equal
rights
,
as
the
Americans
did
to
their
minorities
.
Provided
the
equal
rights
campaign
in
the
US
had
been
very
popular
with
American
Jews
,
surely
they
will
love
to
repeat
it
in
Israel
,
too
.
ORDER
IT
NOW

Palestinian
Christians
,
a
big
native
community
,
are
especially
happy
with
defeat
of
Clinton
who
was
partial
to
radical
Muslims
of
the
Middle
East
.
They
hope
the
US
and
Russia
will
help
to
rebuild
the
community
and
will
protect
them
from
the
extreme
Zionists
and
Wahhabis’
rage
.

The
Russians
are
flabbergasted
with
Trump’s
victory
.
Yes
,
many
of
them
hoped
and
prayed
for
Trump
,
but
practically
all
Russians
I
know
of
were
damn
sure
that
Clinton
would
win
despite
the
popular
vote
.
After
being
manipulated
for
years
,
the
Russians
had
lost
their
belief
in
democratic
process
.
They
were
certain
that
the
banks
,
the
Pentagon
,
the
Supreme
Court
and
the
media
will
force
Clinton’s
election
through
.
My
friends
in
the
Russian
pro
-
Kremlin
media
did
not
believe
that
in
the
US
,
people’s
will
may
prevail
over
the
Masters
of
Discourse
.
Ye
of
small
faith
,
I
told
them
,
everything
can
happen
if
we
want
it
.
Now
they
learned
that
not
everything
is
“sxvacheno”
(
agreed
and
decided
in
advance
)
.

Trump’s
victory
is
the
great
triumph
of
democracy
,
the
next
after
the
Brexit
.
Twice
within
one
year
,
the
people
of
England
and
America
proved
they
can
achieve
what
they
want
,
even
if
the
globalizing
elites
of
bankers
and
media
will
stand
against
them
.
We
can
hope
that
the
elections
in
Europe
will
follow
this
new
pattern
of
true
democracy
,
instead
of
the
fake
one
practiced
recently
.
France
may
be
first
to
get
her
Trump
,
Marine
Le
Pen
.

If
Clinton
had
won
,
there
would
be
more
transgender
toilets
,
more
immigrants
and
more
wars
.
Not
much
fun
.
Now
we
are
entering
the
whole
new
world
of
new
ideas
and
deeds
.
There
are
hundreds
of
suggestions
ripe
to
be
implemented
.
Donald
Trump
can
borrow
a
leaf
from
Kennedy’s
book
and
immediately
start
a
nation
-
wide
discussion
of
what
can
be
done
.
Trump
can
harness
the
energy
of
the
masses
like
has
not
been
done
for
a
century
.
And
yesterday’s
betrayed
Sandernistas
can
take
a
prominent
place
in
this
transformation
.

The
interesting
–
and
dangerous
–
part
begins
right
now
,
after
the
election
.
The
New
York
Times
has
already
proposed:
“Trump
can
be
a
good
president
.
He
just
needs
to
forget
most
of
what
he
said
on
the
campaign
trail
.
”
What
is
good
for
the
New
York
Times
is
bad
for
Trump’s
voters
and
supporters
.
We
hope
Trump
will
avoid
the
danger
of
being
co
-
opted
by
the
people
who
besmirched
him
yesterday
.
Let
him
implement
his
ideas
.
And
let
us
help
him
to
lead
us
into
a
better
and
newer
world
.
