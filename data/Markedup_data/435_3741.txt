The
war
on
law
enforcement
is
epidemic
.
Every
aspect
of
culture
has
been
infected
.
The
anti
-
police
disease
is
highly
contagious
and
rapidly
spreading
on
social
media
,
in
memes
,
in
movements
,
in
popular
fast
food
restaurants
,
at
football
games
,
on
campuses
,
in
media
and
in
every
aspect
of
American
culture
.

An
epidemic
is
defined
as
the
rapid
spread
of
infectious
disease
to
a
large
number
of
people
in
a
given
population
within
a
short
period
of
time
.
Colin
Kaepernick
is
the
Typhoid
Mary
of
the
anti
-
police
epidemic
.
Kaepernick
refuses
to
stand
while
the
U
.
S
.
national
anthem
is
being
performed
at
the
start
of
NFL
games
as
a
protest
against
alleged
racial
injustice
and
police
brutality
.
On
Sept
.
1
Kaepernick
chose
to
kneel
on
one
knee
as
his
protest
gesture
instead
of
just
sitting
on
the
bench
.
His
explanation
for
his
decision
to
switch
is
that
it
was
an
attempt
to
show
more
respect
to
former
and
current
U
.
S
.
military
members
.
As
if
kneeling
is
somehow
symbolically
less
offensive
than
sitting
.
He
misinterpreted
the
meaning
of
the
military
expression
,
‘take
a
knee’
which
occurs
when
troops
take
a
pause
before
continuing
their
mission
.
Similar
to
‘Hands
Up
Don’t
Shoot’
the
anti
-
police
gesture
has
been
imbued
with
a
trendy
righteousness
regardless
of
its
original
meaning
.
The
media
reverently
refers
to
Kaepernick’s
protest
as
‘Taking
a
Knee’
as
if
it
is
some
kind
of
sacred
act
.
There
are
no
headlines
that
read
‘Kaepernick
Disses
the
Flag’
or
‘Kaepernick
Takes
a
Crap
on
his
Country’
.
Just
in
case
his
gesture
didn’t
send
a
clear
enough
message
,
Kaepernick
also
uses
clothing
to
symbolize
his
anti
-
police
sympathies
.
He
has
worn
everything
from
t
-
shirts
honoring
the
militant
Black
Panther
Party
to
socks
that
depict
police
as
pigs
.
In
addition
to
numerous
other
crimes
the
Black
Panther
Party
was
responsible
for
the
murder
of
at
least
15
officers
and
originated
the
expression
‘Off
the
Pigs’
meaning
murder
police
.

Like
the
typhoid
infected
cook
Mary
Mallon
,
Kaepernick
is
rapidly
spreading
the
anti
-
police
pathogen
.
In
what
has
been
dubbed
the
‘Kaepernick
Effect’
dozens
of
NFL
and
WNBA
players
have
knelt
,
sat
,
or
raised
a
fist
during
the
national
anthem
.
The
disease
has
also
spread
to
over
50
high
schools
,
35
colleges
,
and
one
middle
school
.
In
what
can
only
be
described
as
a
bizarre
symbolic
contradiction
there
were
two
incidents
where
women
performing
the
Star
Spangled
Banner
got
down
on
one
knee
in
protest
of
what
they
were
singing
.
One
of
the
women
,
Denasia
Lawrence
,
not
only
kneeled
while
performing
the
anthem
but
also
opened
her
jacket
to
display
a
Black
Lives
Matter
t
-
shirt
exposing
Miami
Heat
fans
to
the
contagious
disorder
.

Rapid
spread
is
well
known
for
infectious
diseases
.
The
anti
-
police
disorder
also
contaminated
the
Navy
.
An
unidentified
sailor
assigned
to
the
Naval
Air
Technical
Training
Center
in
Pensacola
,
Florida
,
filmed
herself
deliberately
not
standing
for
the
National
Anthem
and
posted
it
on
Facebook
.
She
remained
seated
and
raised
a
fist
during
morning
colors
and
then
praised
Colin
Kaepernick
.
Another
sailor
Petty
Officer
2nd
Class
Janaye
Ervin
,
an
intelligence
specialist
in
the
Navy
Reserve
,
stationed
at
Pearl
Harbor
,
did
not
stand
for
the
national
anthem
while
in
uniform
.
She
also
posted
a
statement
on
Facebook
saying
she
was
inspired
by
Colin
Kaepernick
.
The
Navy
acted
decisively
.
She
lost
her
security
clearance
and
may
be
facing
jail
in
response
to
her
actions
.
It
is
yet
to
be
known
if
facing
real
consequences
will
contribute
to
curing
the
virus
or
accelerating
it
.

Kaepernick
is
just
one
carrier
of
the
anti
-
police
disease
.
The
source
of
the
infection
can
be
attributed
to
specific
movements
such
as
Black
Lives
Matter
that
originated
in
Florida
during
the
Trayvon
Martin
protests
.
The
disease
went
airborne
in
Ferguson
,
Missouri
where
it
was
transmitted
to
college
students
,
professional
protesters
and
journalists
who
subsequently
spread
the
disorder
to
towns
and
cities
across
the
country
.
Currently
the
disease
seems
to
cluster
around
populations
that
are
susceptible
to
antipolice
propaganda
.
The
symptoms
are
irrationality
,
excessive
anger
,
impaired
perception
,
anxiety
,
hatred
and
delusions
of
oppression
.
Acute
symptoms
include
sudden
changes
in
behavior
,
aggression
,
paranoia
,
loss
of
control
and
homicidal
and
suicidal
tendencies
.
All
indicators
are
expressed
in
severe
disrespect
for
law
and
order
.

Early
symptoms
of
the
antipolice
epidemic
have
been
observed
in
various
cultural
manifestations
of
contempt
for
law
enforcement
officers
.
Anti
-
police
graffiti
is
a
common
symptom
of
the
virus
.
Writing
has
escalated
from
insults
such
as
‘police
are
murderers’
to
threats
of
violence
.
A
recent
popular
indicator
is
the
expression
‘Kill
Cops’
and
related
variations
such
as
‘Kill
All
Police’
,
‘Save
A
Life
,
Kill
a
Cop’
,
‘Cops
Lives
Don’t
Matter’
and
‘Shoot
Cops’
.
Threats
are
also
depicted
in
images
such
as
guns
to
officers’
heads
.
Violent
anti
-
police
rhetoric
has
also
been
seen
in
protest
signs
that
read
‘All
My
Heroes
Kill
Cops’
,
‘Put
Wings
on
Pigs’
[
Kill
Cops
]
and
‘Cops
Under
Control
Or
Cops
Under
Flowers’
.
Disturbingly
,
anti
-
police
graffiti
,
protests
and
tweets
increase
after
officers
are
murdered
signifying
that
violence
against
cops
is
celebrated
and
glorified
.

The
anti
-
police
epidemic
has
also
spread
to
well
-
known
fast
food
restaurants
.
Employees
have
refused
to
serve
officers
at
a
Taco
Bell
in
Phenix
City
,
AL
;
Dunkin
Donuts
in
West
Hartford
,
CT
;
Krispy
Kreme
in
Columbia
,
SC
;
IHOP
in
Virginia
Beach
,
VA
;
Arby's
in
Pembroke

;

,

;
Whataburger
in
Lewisville
,

;
McDonalds
in
Brenham
,

;
Chipotle
in
Brooklyn
,
NY
;
Genghis
Grill
in
Dallas
,
TX
;
Noodles
&
Company
,
in
Alexandria
,
VA
;
Tropical
Smoothie
in
Winter
Haven
,
FL
;
Lucky’s
Teriyaki
,
Sedro
-
Woolley
,
WA
and
at
the
Krystal
Restaurant
in
Irondale
,
AL
.
Other
incidents
involved
employees
refusing
to
let
an
officer
use
the
restroom
in
a
Philadelphia
Starbucks
,
refusing
service
at
a
Sunoco
gas
station
in
Miramar
,
FL
,
writing
Black
Lives
Matter
on
an
officer’s
coffee
cup
at
a
Dunkin
Donuts
in
Providence
,
RI
and
a
Walmart
Bakery
in
McDonough
,
GA
refusing
to
bake
a
cake
for
a
police
officer’s
retirement
party
.
These
are
just
the
incidents
that
have
been
made
public
.

Refusing
service
at
a
restaurant
goes
beyond
gestures
of
disrespect
.
Law
Enforcement
officers
are
concerned
that
instead
of
simply
being
denied
service
that
their
food
will
be
tampered
with
.
For
this
reason
,
many
officers
will
only
eat
at
restaurants
where
they
can
see
the
food
being
made
.
This
is
a
legitimate
concern
.
On
Aug
23
,
2016
in
Louisville
,
KY
five
police
officers
were
denied
service
at
a
Taco
Bell
.
When
another
employee
took
their
orders
,
they
overheard
a
conversation
between
two
employees
making
the
food
saying
,
“I'm
going
to
mess
with
them
,
”
which
resulted
in
them
walking
out
of
the
restaurant
.
When
officers
have
to
fear
what
is
being
put
in
their
food
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
war
on
police
is
a
full
-
scale
epidemic
.

The
anti
-
police
infection
went
viral
on
social
media
.
Facebook
,
Twitter
,
Instagram
and
other
social
networks
have
hundreds
of
anti
-
police
pages
ridiculing
,
disrespecting
and
threatening
officers
.
Protests
and
riots
are
organized
on
social
media
and
some
users
openly
advocate
and
celebrate
the
killing
of
police
officers
.
The
following
are
examples
of
popular
hashtags:
#
FTP
(
Fuck
The
Police
)
,
#
BlueLivesMurder
,
#
ACAB
(
All
Cops
Are
Bastards
)
,

,
#
FryEmLikeBacon
,
#
BlackLivesMatter
,
#
Ferguson
,
#
MilwaukeeUprising
and
#
Kaepernick
.

As
the
disease
progresses
,
more
acute
symptoms
begin
to
manifest
in
acts
of
violence
.
A
particularly
offensive
indicator
of
the
disorder
is
the
desecration
of
fallen
officer
memorials
.
Memorials
honoring
officers
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
have
been
attacked
in
Philadelphia
,
Chicago
,
Albuquerque
,
Fresno
,
Denver
,
New
Orleans
,
Oakland
,
Austin
,
Honolulu
,
Rochester
,
San
Diego
,
St
.
Paul
,
Covington
,
Richmond
,
Goshen
,
Fayetteville
,
Raleigh
and
many
other
cities
across
the
country
.
Vandalism
has
involved
everything
from
dousing
in
paint
,
toppling
and
scratching
granite
,
burning
,
to
destroying
a
metal
torch
in
order
to
extinguish
the
eternal
flame
.
In
a
previous
article
,
I
described
these
acts
as
symbolic
assassinations
.
Vandals
target
tributes
to
heroic
officers
because
they
want
to
appropriate
the
valor
,
honor
and
respect
that
they
think
they
have
been
deprived
of
.
This
is
another
symptom
of
the
anti
-
police
disease
.
A
sense
of
entitlement
and
resentment
that
leads
to
both
symbolic
and
actual
attacks
on
law
enforcement
officers
.

At
its
most
critical
stage
the
anti
-
police
disorder
is
lethal
.
This
is
expressed
in
the
dozens
of
ambushes
and
killings
of
police
officers
.
In
the
most
acute
phase
of
the
disease
some
of
those
infected
become
homicidal
and
suicidal
targeting
and
killing
officers
knowing
that
they
will
die
in
the
incident
.
A
pattern
has
emerged
that
clearly
demonstrates
that
attacks
on
police
escalate
from
protest
gestures
to
acts
of
vandalism
to
deadly
shootings
that
inspire
further
demonstrations
in
a
continual
cycle
of
protest
and
violence
.
Consequently
,
Kaepernick’s
gesture
is
neither
benign
nor
harmless
.
It
is
one
symptom
in
a
deadly
epidemic
.
