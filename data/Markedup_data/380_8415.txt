How
Hillary
Could
Provoke
A
Nuclear
War
Originally
appeared
at
CounterPunch
Hillary
Clinton
is
an
especially
ardent
enthusiast
of
Full
Spectrum
Dominance
(
FSD
)
.
Diplomacy
is
for
sissies
.
If
they
hesitate
to
capitulate
to
Washington’s
demands
,
up
in
flames
they
go
.
In
an
August
2014
interview
in
The
Atlantic
Clinton
dismissed
negotiations
with
Syria
and
instead
advocated
supporting
the
“hard
men
with
the
guns
.
”
Clinton’s
overwhelmingly
hawkish
instincts
were
detailed
in
a
lengthy
article
by
Mark
Landler
in
this
year’s
April
21
New
York
Times
Magazine
titled
“How
Hillary
Clinton
Became
a
Hawk
.
”
Landler
reports
that
Donald
Trump
and
Ted
Cruz
“are
more
skeptical
than
Clinton
about
intervention
and
more
circumspect
than
she
about
maintaining
the
nation’s
post
-
World
War
II
military
commitments…
neither
Donald
J
.
Trump
nor
Senator
Ted
Cruz
of
Texas
has
demonstrated
anywhere
near
the
appetite
for
military
engagement
that
Clinton
has
.
”
Topping
the
article
off
,
Landler
supports
Clinton’s
bid
for
the
White
House
.
The
Newspaper
of
Record
is
fine
with
war
hawk
Clinton’s
finger
on
the
button
.
This
leaves
us
with
an
especially
pressing
worry:
is
Clinton
likely
to
create
the
equivalent
of
a
latter
-
day
Cuban
Missile
Crisis
?
Her
mania
for
U
.
S
.
global
hegemony
,
the
tilt
to
Asia
with
its
arrogant
and
escalating
provocations
of
China
and
her
coming
extension
of
the
Obama
policy
of
upping
the
ante
with
Russia
,
set
the
stage
for
war
.
The
threat
now
is
that
Clinton
goes
big
time
,
confronting
,
challenging
,
goading
and
working
to
humiliate
two
of
the
Great
Powers
,
sovereignties
that
have
made
it
clear
that
backing
down
is
not
on
the
table
.
We
shall
see
below
that
the
geopolitical
stage
is
set
for
such
a
showdown
.
And
we’ll
see
how
FSD
plus
the
logic
of
the
arms
race
,
now
back
in
swing
with
a
vengeance
,
equals
armed
conflict
unless

.
But
the
Chinese
have
announced
their
unwillingness
to
retreat

S

provocations
,
and
Russia
will
not
cave
in
a
second
time
to
a
Clinton
JFK
impression
.
The
specific
dynamics
of
how
the
combination
of
the
push
for
global
hegemony
plus
the
arms
race
must
lead
to
war
unless
one
of
the
adversaries
backs
down
was
spelled
out
with
characteristic
lucidity
by
Paul
Sweezy
,
the
economist
and
co
-
founder
of
the
magazine
Monthly
Review
(
September
1982
)
,
in
a
remarkable
essay
titled
“Nuclear
Chicken
.
”
Later
in
this
article
I
shall
borrow
from
the
core
argument
of
Sweezy’s
essay
in
applying
his
analysis
to
the
current
conjuncture
.
I
begin
with
a
prefatory
account
of
the
portentous
geopolitical
realities
,
including
leading
think
tanks’
and
media
bigwigs’
attempts
to
revive
what
used
to
be
called
“thinking
the
unthinkable”
.
Russia’s
Nuclear
Superiority
and
Washington’s
Response
Let’s
begin
with
a
summary
of
today’s
arms
race
.
Russia’s
nuclear
capabilities
are
known
to
be
far
superior
to
the
U
.
S
.
’s
,
which
explains
Washington’s
and
NATO’s
threefold
strategy
to
commit
billions
of
dollars
to
upgrading
the
U
.
S
.
nuclear
arsenal
,
to
draw
as
many
as
possible
of
the
former
Soviet
republics
into
NATO
,
so
that
the
alliance
has
expanded
right
up
to
the
Russian
border
and
engaged
in
continuous
NATO
military
exercises
there
,
and
to
deploy
anti
-
missile
systems
in
Eastern
Europe
to
alert
Russia
that
Washington/NATO
is
not
intimidated
or
restrained
by
Russia’s
nuclear
advantage
.
The
clock
has
begun
ticking
.
As
a
recent
Guardian
headline
reports
,
“NATO
countries
begin
largest
war
game
in
eastern
Europe
since
cold
war
.
”
Early
this
month
NATO
launched
Operation
Anaconda
,
the
largest
such
military
exercise
in
a
quarter
century
,
since
the
Soviet
Union
dissolved
in
1991
.
According
to
a
NATO
announcement
,
this
war
game
involves
31
,
000
troops
,
105
aircraft
,
3
,
000
vehicles
and
12
warships
.
The
largest
troop
contingent
,
numbering
14
,
000
is
from
the
United
States
.
5
,
000
NATO
forces
are
currently
carrying
out
similar
actions
in
Lithuania
and
Latvia
.
The
Obama
administration
has
pledged
a
military
confrontation
with
Russia
should
the
unstable
right
-
wing
governments
there
or
in
Estonia
“provoke”
Russia
.
The
stated
aim
of
these
exercises
is
to
anticipate
a
scenario
in
which
NATO
and
Russia
come
to
war
.
In
a
gruesome
irony
,
the
dress
rehearsal
has
German
tanks
crossing
eastward
through
Poland
.
And
in
an
act
at
least
as
bold
and
threatening
as
any
during
the
Cold
War
,
a
new
U
.
S
.
military
headquarters
has
been
created
in
Poland
,
equipped
with
Washington’s
most
advanced
military
equipment
.
NATO
is
building
up
its
forces
in
eastern
Europe
much
as
Germany
did
in
the
run
-
up
of
the
1930s
.
Russia
will
not
take
this
sitting
down
.
The
inevitable
succession
of
escalations
and
counter
-
escalations
portends
nuclear
confrontation
.
Former
Soviet
premier
Mikhail
Gorbachev
described
the
situation
succinctly:
NATO
leaders
“only
talk
about
defense
,
but
actually
they
are
preparing
for
offensive
operations…
All
of
the
rhetoric
in
Warsaw
simply
clamors
for
all
but
declaring
war
on
Russia
.
”
UPI’s
coverage
of
an
early
July
British
Army
annual
Conference
on
Land
Warfare
confirms
Gorbachev’s
concern
.
In
his
presentation
,
an
Army
general
representing
the
U
.
S
.
identified
the
Army’s
top
priority
as
“to
deter
and
if
necessary
defeat
Russia
in
a
war
.
”
Close
nuclear
shaves
have
happened
in
the
past
,
and
the
Guardian
notes
,
in
connection
with
the
present
provocation
,
that
“defense
experts
warn
that
any
mishap
could
prompt
an
offensive
reaction
from
Moscow
.
”
Russia’s
Foreign
Minister
warns
that
“We
do
not
hide
[
our
]
negative
attitude
toward
the
NATO
line
of
moving
its
military
infrastructure
to
our
borders
,
drawing
other
countries
into
military
unit
activities
.
This
will
activate
Russia’s
sovereign
right
to
provide
its
own
safety
with
methods
that
are
adequate
to
today’s
risks
.
”
Clinton’s
mindset
perceives
a
remark
like
this
as
a
challenge
,
rather
than
as
a
reasonable
response
to
provocation
.
She
will
feel
obliged
to
up
the
ante
lest
“we”
appear
to
lack
“resolve”
.
By
this
logic
,
not
to
escalate
in
the
face
of
a
perceived
challenge
is
tantamount
to
capitulation
.
It
is
an
invitation
to
a
Russian
counter
-
escalation
.
The
dynamic
is
self
-
perpetuating
and
is
a
straight
path
to
nuclear
face
-
off
.
Russia
has
more
tactical
nuclear
weapons
and
low
-
yield
nuclear
weapons
than
the
United
States
.
The
world’s
fastest
missile
,
the
SS
-
18
,
can
hit
New
York
City
and
Los
Angeles
in
less
than
25
minutes
.
The
U
.
S
.
has
as
yet
no
effective
deterrent
.
No
less
significant
is
Russia’s
lead
in
anti
-
missile
missiles
.
The
S
-
400
and
S
-
500
can
knock
out
any
US
ICBM
,
cruise
missile
and
stealth
aircraft
.
The
U
.
S
.
F
-
22
,
F
-
35
and
B
-
2
are
rendered
practically
worthless
.
And
China
is
working
toward
an
effective
deterrent
to
any
U
.
S
.
military
adventure:
Russia
is
scheduled
to
soon
deliver
S
-
400s
to
China
.
But
Russia
has
yet
to
install
its
superior
missiles
and
antimissile
missiles
in
every
defense
position
required
to
neutralize
NATO
attacks
in
any
likely
theater
of
war
.
Hence
NATO’s
flurry
to
quickly
surround
Russia
and
weaponize
her
neighbors
.
In
an
attempt
to
overcome
Russia’s
nuclear
advantage
,
Washington/NATO
will
install
putatively
defensive
antimissile
missiles
in
Poland
and
Romania
that
can
be
easily
morphed
into
attack
missiles
capable
of
striking
their
Russian
targets
in
5
minutes
.
Russia
is
then
obliged
to
develop
yet
another
counter
.
NATO
will
attempt
to
outdo
this
measure
.
This
cannot
go
on
forever
.
At
some
point
,
face
-
off
rears
its
head
.
It
is
the
nature
of
this
self
-
perpetuating
race
to
transform
the
notion
of
a
“winner
.
”
The
only
way
this
kind
of
competition
can
be
won
is
for
one
of
the
contestants
to
give
up
,
an
impossible
outcome
,
or
strike
first
.
In
Pentagonese
the
latter
is
called
“counterforce
,
”
the
destruction
of
the
enemy’s
retaliatory
capability
by
a
First
Strike
.
Wackos
like
General
Curtis
LeMay
(
General
Buck
Turgidson
in
Dr
.
Strangelove
)
pushed
this
option
,
which
had
virtually
no
currency
with
top
policy
makers
and
advisors
.
Instead
,
Washington
retained
the
option
of
first
use
,
a
last
resort
when
conventional
means
of
warfare
fail
.
Nuclear
weapons
were
understood
as
deterrents
.
In
the
old
days
,
once
the
Soviet
Union
had
matched
Washington’s
nuclear
capabilities
,
Mutual
Assured
Destruction
(
MAD
)
seemed
to
permanently
consign
nuclear
weapons
to
the
role
of
deterrents
.
In
that
case
,
the
risk
of
nuclear
war
was
reduced
to
close
to
zero
.
And
counterforce
was
off
the
table
.
But
that
was
then
.
Now
we
tremble
under
the
radical
policy
changes
after
the
first
Iraq
war
.
Immediately
after
Iraqi
troops
were
forced
to
retreat
from
Kuwait
in
1991
,
then
president
George
H
.
W
.
Bush
triumphantly
exulted
“By
God
,
we’ve
kicked
the
Vietnam
Syndrome
once
and
for
all
.
”
The
door
was
now
open
not
merely
to
“low
-
intensity
warfare”
and
local
counterinsurgency
aggressions
,
but
to
larger
-
scale
interventions
on
a
limitless
scale
.
Pushing
the
envelope
further
still
,
the
George
W
.
Bush
administration
repudiated
the
ABM
treaty
and
officially
opened
the
door
to
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
in
a
First
Strike
.
Deterrence
was
no
longer
the
principal
function
of
nuclear
weapons
policy
.
As
we
shall
see
,
nuclear
weapons
were
soon
thereafter
to
become
routinely
regarded
by
policymakers
as
instruments
of
“conventional”
warfare
.
We
shall
see
below
that
major
think
tanks
and
policymakers
are
now
up
to
their
ears
in
detailed
planning
for
nuclear
confrontations
with
China
and
Russia
.
This
is
the
context
surrounding
the
rise
to
the
presidency
of
the
person
with
perhaps
the
itchiest
trigger
finger
in
Washington
.
Most
of
us
used
to
think
that
MAD
ruled
out
another
potential
apocalypse
like
the
Cuban
Missile
Crisis
.
No
one
can
believe
that
now
.
The
soul
-
searing
anxiety
much
of
the
world
experienced
during
the
Cold
War
years
preceding
the
Soviets’
achievement
of
nuclear
parity
with
Washington
has
been
restored
.
The
Political
Psychology
and
Arms
-
Race
Logic
of
U
.
S
.
Militarism:
the
Need
to
Maintain
“Credibility”
It
is
an
axiom
of
imperial
politics
that
the
hegemon
can
under
no
circumstances
give
up
.
Washington
has
claimed
not
merely
unsurpassed
but
unequalled
global
military
predominance
.
And
Sam
has
been
consistent:
since
the
aspiration
to
FSD
is
bound
to
meet
resistance
,
Washington
must
be
committed
to
permanent
war
,
a
doctrine
once
associated
by
Dick
Cheney
and
Associates
,
but
now
embraced
by
the
entire
policy
-
making
establishment
.
Because
Russia’s
actually
existing
potential
for
universal
deterrence
takes
time
to
fully
put
in
place
,
the
U
.
S
.
must
in
the
meantime
convince
the
world
that
it
means
business
.
The
master
imperative
of
hegemony
is
that
Washington
must
maintain
its
credibility
.
”
Clinton
talks
of
“resolve
.
”
Same
thing
.
In
the
context
of
nuclear
warmongering
,
this
means
that
if
Washington
is
to
get
what
it
wants
from
other
nations
,
it
must
wield
the
threat
of
a
nuclear
strike
,
but
that
strategy
is
useless
unless
the
threat
is
believable
.
When
push
comes
to
shove
,
as
we
shall
see
below
,
the
only
convincing
proof
of
the
threat’s
credibility
is
the
actual
use
of
nuclear
weapons
.
Part
of
what
this
entails
is
taking
action
,
on
the
principle
that
“if
you
are
not
with
us
you
are
against
us
,
”
against
regimes
that
do
not
pledge
allegiance
to
the
imperial
project
.
Hence
,
nations
that
assert
independence
,
or
ally
themselves
with
influential
powers
opposing
U
.
S
.
hegemony
,
shall
be
pummeled
,
destroyed
as
functioning
states
,
threatened
,
or
subverted:

Military
incursions
have
been
limited
to
conventional
means
of
destruction
.
None
of
these
aggressions
has
so
far
threatened
a
major
nuclear
confrontation
with
a
Great
Power
.
We
have
as
yet
seen
nothing
comparable
to
the
Cuban
Missile
Crisis
.
As
yet
.
But
this
is
set
to
change
.
We
shall
see
in
the
following
section
that
nuclear
war
has
now
become
the
obsession
of
policymakers
and
policy
-
related
think
tanks
.
The
Elite
Consensus
around
Thinking
the
Unthinkable
Washington's
recent
escalations
are
reflected
in
recent
elite
exhortations
to
revive
military
-
confrontations
of
the
Cold
War
era
.
In
a
recent
issue
of
Foreign
Affairs
John
J
.
Mearsheimer
and
Stephen
M
.
Walt
state:
"
There
are
regions
outside
the
Western
Hemisphere
that
are
worth
expending
American
blood
and
treasure
to
defend
.
.
.
In
Europe
and
Northeast
Asia
,
the
chief
concern
is
the
rise
of
a
regional
hegemon
that
would
dominate
its
region
,
much
as
the
United
States
dominates
the
Western
Hemisphere
.
”
Here
is
an
explicit
statement
of
the
doctrine
of
FSD:
the
U
.
S

must
dominate
the
globe's
every
region
.
Regional
"
spheres
of

are
no
longer
part
of
the

thinking
.
In
a
May
Washington
Post
editorial
titled
“The
Liberal
International
Order
is
Under
Fire
.
The
United
States
Must
Defend
It
.
”
we
are
warned
that
;
Hardly
a
day
goes
by
without
evidence
that
the
liberal
international
order
of
the
past
seven
decades
is
being
eroded
.
China
and
Russia
are
attempting
to
fashion
a
world
in
their
own
illiberal
image…
This
poses
an
enormous
trial
for
the
next
U
.
S
.
president…
no
matter
who
takes
the
Oval
Office
,
it
will
demand
courage
to
demand
difficult
decisions
to
save
the
liberal
international
order…
The
United
States
must
keep
trying
to
integrate
China
into
the
rules
and
traditions
of
the
liberal
international
order—a
policy
of
eight
presidential
administrations—while
also
marshaling
forces
to
confront
China’s
assertive
and
unilateral
grab
of
territory
in
the
South
China
Sea
.
Likewise
,
stabilizing
Ukraine
and
saving
it
economically
will
be
a
vital
bulwark
against
Russia’s
violent
subversion
.
The
“liberal
international
order”
is
the
capitalist
globe
as
dominated
by
the
U
.
S
.
China
and
Russia
are
not
attempting
to
“fashion
the
world”
into
anything
at
all
.
Russia
is
involved
in
no
“violent
subversion
.
”
The
reality
is
that
these
powers
are
feared
to
develop
sufficient
power
and
influence
to
obstruct
America’s
ability
to
call
the
international
shots
,
to
predominate
politically
and
militarily
everywhere
,
including
in
China’s
and
Russia’s
neighborhoods
.
A
comparably
enormous
U
.
S
.
hegemonic
counter
-
power
must
be
put
into
place
.
This
will
involve
“difficult
decisions
.
”
Meaning
that
the
U
.
S
.
leadership
must
be
prepared
to
risk
military
confrontation
in
order
to
scare
away
these
obstacles
to
U
.
S
.

The
Post
cites
a
report
by
the
Center
For
a
New
American
Security
,
chaired
by
the
neocon
war
hawk
Robert
Kagan
,
in
support
of
a
stepped
-
up
global
imperial
campaign
.
Kagan’s
report
,
titled
“Extending
American
Power:
Strategies
to
Expand
U
.
S
.
Engagement
in
a
Competitive
World
Order
,
”
lays
the
cards
on
the
table:
“At
a
time
when
partisanship
in
the
American
political
establishment
has
reached
unprecedented
heights
,
the
group
believes
it
is
more
important
than
ever
to
rebuild
the
national
consensus
on
America’s
role
in
the
world
.
This
project
promotes
the
idea
that
American
leadership
is
critical
to
preserving
and
strengthening
the
bedrock
of
today’s
international
order
,
which
is
being
shaken
by
a
variety
of
forces
.
”
Two
key
rationales
are
evident
.
The
global
system
directed
by
America’s
“leadership”
is
under
threat
.
Steps
must
be
taken
.
And
Kagan
calls
upon
the
erstwhile
strategy
of
externalizing
domestic
tensions
.
The
Trump
-
Clinton
-
Sanders
debate
has
reintroduced
a
dangerous
“partisanship”
[
read:
debate
beyond
permissible
orthodox
limits
]
which
threatens
“national
consensus”
[
read:
debate
within
mainstream
parameters
]
.
A
national
campaign
peddled
as
a
defense
against
global
threats
to
American
freedom
can
neutralize
partisanship
by
directing
domestic
discontent
to
external
enemies
.
And
there’s
nothing
like
war
to
unite
a
nation
internally
riven
.
A
recent
report
by
the
influential
Center
for
Strategic
and
Budgetary
Assessments
rationalizes
the
current
multibillion
dollar
nuclear
buildup
.
The
report
focuses
on
U
.
S
.
tensions
with
Russia
,
and
is
frighteningly
titled
Rethinking
Armageddon
(
RA
)
.
The
conceit
behind
the
title
is
that
we
must
put
behind
us
the
belief
that
Russia’s
achievement
of
nuclear
parity
with
the
U
.
S
.
guaranteed
Mutual
Assured
Destruction
(
MAD
)
,
and
undermined
the
feasibility
of
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
.
On
the
contrary
,
argues
RA
,
we
are
now
in
a
“second
nuclear
age”
which
frees
the
U
.
S
.
to
deploy
nuclear
weapons
“in
a
discriminate
manner
.
”
The
report
is
introduced
with
a
citation
from
the
Cold
Warrior
John
Foster
Dulles:
“If
you
are
scared
to
go
to
the
brink
,
you
are
lost
.
”
In
a
spine
-
chilling
clue
to
what
could
be
the
second
major
historic
instance
of
nuclear
brinksmanship
,
RA
outlines
a
scenario
in
which
Washington
is
on
the
brink
of
a
confrontation
with
Russia
.
Putin
announces
that
Russian
forces
will
provide
humanitarian
assistance
to
civilians
“displaced
from
their
homes
by
Latvia’s
aggressive
and
violent
efforts
to
suppress
the
rights
of
ethnic
Russians
.
”
The
U
.
S
.
has
,
according
to
RA
,
four
options
,
three
of
which
require
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
against
Russia
.
Under
what
RA
regards
as
the
old
-
hat
thinking
about
MAD
,
such
options
would
have
been
ruled
out
.
No
more
.
RA’s
conception
of
a
“limited”
nuclear
strategy
that
would
not
provoke
a
more
intense
engagement
would
have
the
U
.
S
.
deploy
“a
small
number
of
weapons”
early
on
in
the
conflict
.
That
way
the
Russians
would
be
convinced
that
we
mean
business
and
would
not
risk
further
conflagration
.
They
would
simply
concede
defeat
and
back
off
.
We
are
to
believe
Russia
would
embrace
the
inescapable
implication
of
RA’s
strategy
,
that
it
would
accept
U
.
S
.
FSD
and
resign
itself
to
taking
orders
from
Washington
.
Not
a
chance
.
So
intense
is
Uncle
Sam’s
hunger
for
global
predominance
that
he
cannot
assess
with
a
modicum
of
rationality
the
consequences
of
his
Olympian
ambitions
.
Hillary
Clinton
specializes
in
this
kind
of
self
-
delusion
.
And
Obama
has
prepared
her
opportunity:
the
administration
has
pledged
to
take
military
action
against
Russia
should
the
unstable
right
-
wing
regimes
of
Latvia
,
Lithuania
or
Estonia
provoke
the
Bear
,
e
.
g
.
by
persecuting
these
countries’
Russian
-
speaking
,
Russia
-
friendly
minorities
.
Was
the
administration
unaware
of
Putin’s
promise
of
aid
should
Latvian
ethnic
Russians
be
persecuted
?
Russia
is
not
the
only
potential
object
of
Washington’s
perilous
provocation
.
Uncle
Sam
has
China
too
in
the
bullseye
.
Washington’s
“Tilt
To
Asia”
and
Provoking
China
Shortly
after
Obama’s
inauguration
,
Washington
sent
the
Navy
surveillance
ships
the
USNS
Impeccable
and
the
USNS
Victorious
into
China’s
EEZ
(
exclusive
economic
zone
)
.
This
was
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
escalating
provocations
.
The
Chinese
responded
rationally
,
by
installing
defensive
missiles
around
the
zone
.
The
New
York
Times
reports
the
most
recent
application
of
this
strategy
,
in
a
story
titled
“U
.
S
.
Carriers
Sail
in
Western
Pacific
,
Hoping
China
Takes
Notice
.
”
In
mid
-
June
Washington
engaged
two
U
.
S
.
carrier
groups
,
led
by
the
U
.
S
.
S
.
John
Stennis
and
the
U
.
S
.
S
.
Ronald
Reagan
,
in
joint
deployments
into
the
Philippine
Sea
.
12
,
000
sailors
,
140
aircraft
,
and
six
smaller
battleships
conducted
joint
surveillance
operations
.
This
was
only
the
most
recent
incitement
in
a
series
of
instigations
.
In
the
10
days
prior
to
the
above
exercise
,
the
Stennis
and
Reagan
had
conducted
joint
maneuvers
in
the
South
China
Sea
with
Japanese
and
Indian
navies
,
after
deploying
four
Navy
Growlers
,
electronic
warfare
planes
and
120
military
personnel
to
Clark
Air
Base
in
the
Philippines
.
Washington
has
in
the
last
two
years
recruited
leading
powers
in
the
Asia
-
Pacific
region
,
and
in
March
and
April
began
a
sharp
escalation
of
its
military
threats
.
Japan
and
Australia
,
and
other
allies
including
Singapore
,
Vietnam
,
Malaysia
,
the
Philippines
and
Indonesia
have
initiated
hostile
operations
against
China
.
Most
of
these
countries
have
been
encouraged
by
Washington
to
develop
their
naval
power
,
and
have
subsequently
increased
their
military
spending
.
In
2015
alone
the
Philippines
increased
military
spending
by
more
than
25
percent
,
and
Thailand
,
Vietnam
,
Singapore
and
Malaysia
by
5
to
16
percent
.
Age
-
old
and
geopolitically
insignificant
contestations
over
reefs
and
small
islands
have
been
resurrected
in
defense
of
these
provocations
.
Vietnam
has
in
recent
months
secretly
fortified
several
of
its
islands
in
the
Spratly
group
in
the
South
China
Sea
with
mobile
long
range
rocket
launchers
.
It
would
take
only
days
to
make
them
operational
with
rockets
capable
of
striking
Chinese
-
held
islets
.
Hanoi’s
move
is
certain
to
further
accelerate
the
arms
race
that
is
already
underway
and
to
heighten
the
risk
that
an
incident
or
provocation
could
lead
to
military
conflict
.
That
danger
has
escalated
in
the
wake
of
the
ruling
last
month
by
the
Permanent
Court
of
Arbitration
in
The
Hague
in
favor
of
a
U
.
S
.
-backed
case
brought
by
the
Philippines
to
challenge
China’s
territorial
claims
in
the
South
China
Sea
.
A
recent
Reuters
report
revealed
that
Vietnam
has
shipped
its
launchers
to
five
of
its
Spratly
islands
and
carefully
hidden
them
from
aerial
surveillance
.
The
launchers
are
part
of
Vietnam’s
EXTRA
rocket
artillery
system
purchased
recently
from
Israel
.
The
system
uses
targeting
drones
,
is
highly
accurate
up
to
150
kilometers
and
can
deliver
a
150
kilogram
warhead
that
can
hit
ships
and
land
targets
.
Chinese
installations
on
Subi
,
Fiery
Cross
and
Mischief
Reef
would
be
well
within
the
range
of
Vietnamese
rockets
.
In
an
alarming
development
,
Admiral
Henry
Harris
,
the
commander
of
U
.
S
.
Pacific
Forces
,
is
pressing
for
further
aggression
to
take
place
inside
the
12
-
mile
exclusion
zone
around
territory
held
by
China
.
According
to
Navy
Times
the
commander
“wants
to
drive
through
an
area
and
do
military
operations
,
”
which
would
include
launching
aircraft
and
firing
weapons
systems
.
The
Obama
administration
is
reluctant
to
push
this
hard
,
but
Clinton
,
who
promises
to
escalate
the
violence
in
Syria
beyond
what
the
administration
prefers
,
is
characteristically
more
in
tune
with
the
most
aggressive
recommendations
.
The
Times
warns
that
,
in
the
light
of
the
current
escalations—which
do
not
include
the
batty
incursions
urged
by
Admiral
Harris—“some
sort
of
confrontation
seems
increasingly
likely
.
”
Chinese
officials
agree
.
A
specialist
in
military
strategy
associated
with
the
People’s
Liberation
Army
warns
that
“China
will
very
likely
strike
back
if
the
U
.
S
.
comes
within
12
miles
of
the
[
Nansha
]
islands
.
”
Another
military
authority
at
Nanjing
University
alerted
Washington
that
“The
U
.
S
.
provocation
has
boosted
the
chance
of
military
confrontation
between
Beijing
and
Washington
.
”
And
the
state
-
controlled
Global
Times
warns
that
“China
hopes
that
disputes
can
be
resolved
by
talks
,
but
it
must
be
prepared
for
any
military
confrontation
.
”
This
has
not
deterred
the
U
.
S
.
from
developing
detailed
plans
for
war
with
China
.
The
Mitchell
Institute
For
Aerospace
Studies
has
reported
that
Air
Force
officers
are
preparing
the
most
detailed
plans
to
date
for
deploying
the
F
-
35
,
the
most
advanced
fighter
plane
,
in
an
all
-
out
war
with
China
.
Is
our
next
president
licking
her
chops
at
the
opportunity
to
play
her
favorite
game
?
Prominent
think
tanks
have
recently
provided
grist
for
Clinton’s
mill
.
Last
year
the
Council
on
Foreign
Relations
,
the
leading
elite
foreign
-
policy
think
tank
,
released
a
study
titled
“Revising
U
.
S
.
Grand
Strategy
Toward
China”
.
The
upshot
is
that
antagonisms
are
growing
between
what
the
council
considers
the
world’s
two
most
powerful
nations
,
tensions
that
require
an
escalation
of
Washington’s
policy
of
confrontation
.
The
hostilities
are
grounded
in
China’s
reluctance
to
embrace
the
core
of
U
.
S
.
foreign
policy
,
identified
thus
by
the
Council:
“Preserving
U
.
S
.
primacy
in
the
global
system
ought
to
remain
the
central
objective
of
U
.
S
.
grand
strategy
in
the
twenty
-
first
century
.
”
The
“threat”
to
U
.
S
.
national
interests
consists
in
China’s
refusal
to
submit
to
the
U
.
S
.
demand
that
it
exercise
no
predominant
influence
in
its
own
neighborhood
!
What
unsettles
elites
most
,
according
to
the
Council
,
is
the
“challenge
by
China
to
U
.
S
.
primacy
in
Asia
.
”
This
is
but
one
of
the
horrifying
corollaries
of
FSD
.
Under
a
Clinton
presidency
,
this
amounts
to
a
virtual
invitation
to
war
.
The
RAND
Corporation
has
taken
up
planning
for
war
with
China
in
a
study
commissioned
by
the
U
.
S
.
Army
titled
“War
with
China:
Thinking
Through
the
Unthinkable
.
”
The
phrase
“thinking
the
unthinkable”
was
coined
by
RAND’s
chief
postwar
strategist
,
the
Strangelove
counterpart
Herman
Kahn
,
whose
book
On
Thermonuclear
War
advanced
a
strategy
for
winning
a
nuclear
war
against
the
Soviet
Union
.
The
study
makes
it
clear
that
war
with
China
is
by
no
means
out
of
the
question
,
but
stresses
that
as
time
passes
Washington’s
nuclear
advantage
is
sure
to
decline
.
The
clear
implication
is
that
sooner
is
better
than
later
.
Rand
anticipates
that
military
action
against
China
will
foment
a
resurgent
antiwar
movement
,
in
which
case
the
“system
of
civilian
control”
will
be
deployed
for
large
-
scale
suppression
.
As
if
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
coming
commander
in
-
chief
,
the
administration
has
begun
a
massive
nuclear
weapons
“modernization”
program
.
The
Stockholm
International
Peace
Research
Institute
comments
that
“The
ambitious
U
.
S
.
modernization
plan
presented
by
the
Obama
Administration
is
in
stark
contrast
to
President
Obama’s
pledge
to
reduce
the
number
of
nuclear
weapons
and
the
role
they
play
in
U
.
S
.
national
security
strategy
.
”
The
Stockholm
Institute
,
of
course
,
is
shocked
,
shocked
by
yet
another
Obama
lie
.
Against
this
background
,
only
the
blind
fail
to
see
the
coming
to
power
of
the
warmonger
Clinton
as
placing
another
world
-
historic
crisis
on
the
agenda
.
A
realistic
example
of
the
impending
threat
is
found
in
one
of
RA’s
scenarios
for
nuclear
confrontation
between
the
U
.
S
.
and
Russia
.
A
key
trigger
of
war
would
be
that
“the
limited
reaction
of
the
United
States
and
Europe
to
Russia’s
actions
in
Ukraine
and
Syria
,
however
,
have
eroded
their
credibility…”
.
RA
outlines
similar
credibility
crises
in
Estonia
,
Latvia
and
Lithuania
.
Let
us
look
further
into
the
pivotal
notion
of
maintaining
credibility—Clinton’s
“resolve”—in
the
history
of
nuclear
geopolitics
.
Hegemonic
Credibility
in
the
Last
Potential
Armageddon:
The
Postwar
Arms
Race
and
the
Cuban
Missile
Crisis
Dwight
Eisenhower
,
in
his
memoirs
Mandate
For
Change
,
spelled
out
the
fundamental
rationale
of
U
.
S
.
nuclear
policy
when
Washington
was
a
nuclear
-
weapons
monopolist:
“My
feeling
was
[
during
the
Korean
war
]
,
and
still
remains
,
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
United
States
to
maintain
the
military
commitments
which
it
now
sustains
around
the
world…
did
we
not
possess
nuclear
weapons
and
the
will
to
use
them
when
necessary
.
”
Mere
possession
of
the
weaponry
is
not
enough
.
There
must
be
the
credible
threat
to
use
them
.
That
threat
was
an
established
practice
in
postwar
U
.
S
.
foreign
policy
.

•
Nixon’s
1969
threat
to
use
nuclear
weapons
in
North
Vietnam
It
was
the
Cuban

Crisis
,
when
John
F
.
Kennedy
threatened
to
nuke
Russian
-
installed
Cuban
Missile
sites
unless
Khrushchev
had
them
removed
,
that
prompted
the
Soviets
to
conclude
that
lest
they
be
permanently
subject
to
nuclear
bullying
the
Soviet
Union
must
surpass
U
.
S
.
nuclear
capabilities
.
By
the
mid
to
late
1970s
,
the
Soviets
had
achieved
nuclear
parity
with
the
U
.
S
.
Not
only
had
Washington
lost
its
nuclear
monopoly
,
but
not
too
long
afterwards
the
Soviets
were
to
achieve
defensive
superiority
.
The
world
-
historic
upshot
of
this
development
is
that
Washington’s
nuclear
threats
had
lost
their
credibility
.
Recall
that
the
ultimate
test
of
credibility
is
actual
use
.
The
1945
atomic
bombing
of
Japan
had
shown
that
Washington
was
indeed
willing
to
use
these
weapons
for
geopolitical
purposes
.
But
actual
use
is
only
a
necessary
condition
of
credibility
;
the
intimidator
must
also
be
a
nuclear
monopolist
.
With
the
U
.
S
.
no
longer
a
nuclear
monopolist
,
actual
use
was
thought
to
be
ruled
out
by
virtue
of
MAD
.
Nuclear
threats
were
no
longer
credible
.
The
looming
threat
of
nuclear
annihilation
seemed
gone
forever
.
The
rest
of
the
world
was
freer
to
do
what
it
pleased
.
Thereafter
,
the
rationale
for
nuclear
weaponry
was
generally
acknowledged
to
be
deterrence
.
“Counterforce
,
”
i
.
e
.
First
Strike
,
was
out
of
the
question
.
Accordingly
,
the
nuclear
disarmament
movement
virtually
vanished
.
But
only
for
a
short
while
.
In
late
1981
and
through
1982
not
only
did
the
U
.
S
.
anti
-
nuke
movement
revive
,
but
a
hitherto
hardly
existent
European
nuclear
disarmament
movement
came
into
being
.
What
precipitated
this
movement
was
the
NATO
decision
in
December
1979
to
augment
its
European
nuclear
arsenal
with
Pershing
and
Cruise
missiles
,
correctly
perceived
by
the
Soviets
and
by
activists
as
counterforce
(
First
Strike
)
weapons
.
Two
consequences
of
this
unexpected
move
became
evident
.
For
the
first
time
,
nuclear
confrontation
in
the
European
theater
became
a
live
option
,
shifting
the
risk
of
nuclear
war
from
the
U
.
S
.
to
the
NATO
partners
.
When
European
activists
declared
this
shift
to
be
intolerable
,
Reagan’s
Secretary
of
State
Alexander
Haig
rejoined
“There
are
worse
things
than
nuclear
war
.
”
The
antiwar
movement
in
Europe
exploded
.
Secondly
,
the
Soviets
saw
this
as
upsetting
what
had
been
a
stable
balance
of
forces
in
Europe
by
restoring
the
functional
equivalent
of
U
.
S
.
/NATO
nuclear
superiority
.
Both
Great
Powers
had
been
building
their
deterrent
capacities
all
along
,
but
Washington
arbitrarily
cited
the
latest
Soviet
development
as
the
reason
for
the
dramatic
buildup
in
Europe
.
A
compelling
explanation
of
Washington’s
escalation
was
put
forward
by
Paul
Sweezy
in
the
essay
cited
above
.
Sweezy
noted
that
the
U
.
S
.
had
always
been
the
prime
initiator
of
nuclear
weapons
buildups
,
he
took
seriously
the
implications
of
the
need
that
the
nuclear
threat
be
credible
,
and
he
observed
recent
major
shifts
in
global
power
in
relation
to
these
implications
.
The
most
conspicuous
development
preceding
the
new
buildup
was
the
stunning
series
of
defeats
for
imperialism
that
had
occurred
during
the
1970s
.
Eisenhower’s
pre
-
MAD
assertion
that
U
.
S
.
global
hegemony
required
that
Washington
must
have
“the
will
to
use
[
nuclear
weapons
]
when
necessary”
made
imperial
sense
prior
to
MAD
.
But
his
words
became
empty
after
the
U
.
S
.
lost
its
nuclear
monopoly
.
Why
?
Because
the
credibility
of
the
nuclear
threat
was
lost
once
Uncle
Sam
was
no
longer
the
only
master
gunslinger
in
town
.
The
1970s
provided
powerful
evidence
that
the
U
.
S
.
had
come
to
suffer
a
conspicuous
relative
decline
in
its
military
power
and
therefore
,
in
today’s
parlance
,
in
its
ability
to
exercise
Full
Spectrum
Dominance
.
Here’s
what
global
resistance
accomplished
in
the
1970s:
•
Portugal
lost
its
African
colonies
in
1974
•
a
year
later
the
U
.
S
.
lost
the
Vietnam
war
•
one
of
the
U
.
S
.
’s
major
Central
American
clients
,
Anastasio
Somoza
,
was
over
thrown
out
of
Nicaragua
by
a
socialist
opposition
•
as
a
result
,
insurgencies
spread
in
other
parts
of
Central
America
•
in
Zimbabwe
a
national
liberation
movement
came
to
power
•
the
regime
of
the
Shah
of
Iran
,
Washington’s
paramount
junior
partner
in
the
Middle
East
,
was
overthrown
by
anti
-
Western
revolutionaries
The
fall
of
the
Shah
was
arguably
as
devastating
a
defeat
for
U
.
S
.
imperialism
as
was
the
defeat
in
Vietnam
.
Billions
of
dollars
of
advanced
weaponry
was
transferred
to
a
hostile
power
,
as
were
the
prized
oil
fields
.
To
the
ruling
class
,
the
U
.
S
.
now
looked
to
the
world
like
a
“pitiful
,
helpless
giant”
(
the
term
used
by
Nixon
to
justify
the
invasion
of
Cambodia
and
the
bombing
of
North
Vietnam
)
.
It
appeared
that
what
we
say
doesn’t
go
.
The
defeat
was
hammered
home
in
November
1979
,
when
the
Ayatollah’s
regime
seized
52
American
hostages
in
Teheran
and
held
them
for
444
days
.
Adding
further
insult
to
further
injury
,
shortly
afterwards
the
Soviets
moved
into
Afghanistan
.
How
must
all
this
appear
to
a
class
that
wants
to
rule
the
world
by
nuclear
intimidation
?
Soon
after
the
foregoing
setbacks
,
Jimmy
Carter
announced
the
Carter
Doctrine
,
which
included
which
included
the
threat
to
use
nuclear
weapons
should
the
Soviets
move
toward
Iran’s
oil
fields
,
and
announced
years
of
coming
increases
in
the
defense
budget
.
The
reaction
to
the
defeats
of
the
1970s
was
evident
in
U
.
S
.
policy
into
the
Reagan
years
.
On
May
30
,
1982
,
The
New
York
Times
featured
an
article
titled
“Pentagon
Draws
Up
First
Strategy
For
Fighting
A
Long
Nuclear
War
,
”
describing
a
“limited”
a
nuclear
war
in
Europe
and
Pentagon
plans
for
fighting
a
“protracted”
nuclear
war
against
the
Soviets
.
This
was
merely
the
latest
,
albeit
markedly
stepped
-
up
,
version
of
the
going
strategy
regarding
nuclear
escalation:
to
make
Washington’s
enemies
believe
that
the
U
.
S
.
was
really
preparing
to
fight
and
win
a
nuclear
war
.
Elites
were
not
so
stupid
as
to
be
unaware
of
the
suicidal
and
self
-
destructive
consequences
of
initiating
a
nuclear
war
.
Escalating
buildups
were
intended
to
induce
the
fear
that
the
threat
was
credible
and
so
to
inhibit
behavior
unacceptable
to
Uncle
Sam
.
Deterrence
was
still
the
name
of
the
game
.
After
all
,
it
worked
in
Cuba
in
October
1962
and
it
was
perceived
to
have
worked
in
the
six
instances
of
atomic
diplomacy
enumerated
above
.
What
has
emerged
is
a
qualitatively
new
phase
in
the
arms
race
and
in
nuclear
-
weapons
policy
.
As
noted
above
,
it
is
only
in
recent
years
that
the
full
import
of
the
rejection
of
MAD
as
the
basis
for
the
policy
of
deterrence
and
the
consequent
openness
to
First
Strike
as
a
viable
option
in
Washington’s
pursuit
of
FSD
have
been
openly
embraced
by
elites
.
The
turn
to
Armageddon
has
naturally
resulted
in
detailed
strategic
planning
,
including
large
-
scale
redeployment
of
troops
and
nuclear
weapons
in
regions
chosen
for
their
suitability
for
aggression
against
those
powers
perceived
by
Washington
to
be
major
impediments
to
U
.
S
.
dominance
.
Never
before
have
such
arrogant
provocations
been
exercised
.
Developments
since
the
1970s
have
unfolded
as
they
would
had
the
U
.
S
.
no
nuclear
weapons
.
We
might
as
well
not
have
them
.
Hence
the
current
multi
-
billion
-
dollar
new
nuclear
buildup
.
The
credibility
of
the
nuclear
threat
appears
to
have
been
permanently
undermined
.
Deterrence
is
therefore
no
longer
the
rationale
for
nuclear
weapons
policy
.
The
alternatives
now
are
no
use
or
first
use
.
And
no
use
is
out
of
the
question
.
Enter
Hillary
Clinton
.
The
Present
in
the
Light
of
the
Past
Elites
no
longer
have
the
assurance
that
comes
of
perceived
omnipotence
.
A
number
of
setbacks
have
undermined
Uncle
Sam’s
conceit
of
omnipotence
and
motivated
the
U
.
S
.
to
escalate
enormously
its
global
aggression
in
a
delirious
effort
to
intimidate
its
principal
rivals
and
restore
the
credibility
of
the
ultimate
threat
.
Among
these
comedowns
are
the
serial
failure
to
achieve
stated
objectives
in
Vietnam
,
Iraq
,
Iran
and
Libya
,
the
stated
determination
of
some
states
to
replace
the
dollar
as
a
universal
reserve
currency
,
the
acceptance
by
oil
producers
like
Iraq
,
Iran
and
Libya
of
payment
for
oil
in
currencies
other
than
the
dollar
,
the
emergence
of
non
-
state
effective
challengers
to
Washington’s
global
predominance
,
such
as
the
mujahideen
,
al
Qaeda
and
ISIS
and
increasing
talk
of
the
formation
of
regional
trade
blocs
discarding
the
dollar
altogether
in
the
blocs’
trade
and
investment
relations
.
Clinton’s
notorious
bellicosity
is
in
part
a
cry
of
desperation
at
these
seemingly
intractable
obstacles
to
FSD
.
Her
overblown
swagger
betrays
a
sense
of
vulnerability
and
uncertainty
that
provokes
lashing
out
,
an
especially
dangerous
impulse
in
a
chief
executive
who
appears
constitutionally
disposed
to
imperial
brutality
and
pathologically
assured
of
Washington’s
entitlement
to
global
obeisance
.
Clinton
harbors
a
deep
resentment
of
Washington’s
declining
credibility
.
Her
determination
to
demonstrate
U
.
S
.
“resolve”
in
the
context
of
present
historic
military
provocations
nurses
a
tendency
to
brinksmanship
.
If
she
experiences
the
variety
of
defeats
and
obstacles
to
U
.
S
.
economic
and
military
hegemony
the
way
elites
perceived
the
profound
defeats
of
the
1970s
,
and
if
these
fetters
seem
to
her
unbreakable
by
conventional
military
means
,
the
option
of
nuclear
chicken
presents
itself
as

the
word
appropriate
to

who
has

John
F

Kennedy
will
be
invoked
as
a
courageous
leader
whose
readiness
to
risk
Armageddon
was
testimony
to
the
depth
of
America’s
commitment
to
freedom
and
democracy
everywhere
.
In
the
July
24
New
York
Times
,
the
most
widely
read
Clinton
propaganda
venue
,
the
editorial
board
provides
an
indication
of
the
likely
chicken
-
inducing
scenarios
to
come
.
The
paper’s
comments
are
entirely
in
step
with
the
frightening
analyses
of
the
think
tanks
discussed
above
.
The
Times
is
troubled
that
Trump
is
not
as
reliable
a
war
hawk
as
Clinton
.
Obama
had
promised
the
far
-
right
anti
-
Russian
regimes
in
the
Baltic
states
of
Lithuania
,
Latvia
and
Estonia
.
U

military
intervention

including
troops

,
should
any
of
these
regimes
allege
Russian
interference
,
e
.
g
.
,
defense
of
the
rights
of
ethnic
Russians
.
The
Times
regards
Trump’s
reluctant
willingness
to
go
to
war
against
“an
increasingly
aggressive”
Russia
on
behalf
of
these
states
as
unduly
conditional
on
their
having
“fulfilled
their
obligations”
to
the
United
States
.
This
would
,
the
Times
fears
,
“play
into
the
hands
of
Russia’s
president
,
Vladimir
Putin
,
”
Washington’s
Hitler
du
jour
.
The
newspaper
is
also
distressed
that
Trump
is
unenthusiastic
about
the
deployment
of
U
.
S
.
troops
in
Korea
and
Japan
.
This
would
“significantly
reduce
American
influence
at
a
time
of
increasing
Chinese
aggression
.
”
Clinton
has
promised
to
continue
the
policies
of
Obama
.
Uh
-
oh
.
A
recent
front
-
page
Times
article
reminds
us
that
Obama
“has
now
been
at
war
longer
than
Mr

Bush
,
or
any
other
American
president
.
.
.
he
will
leave
behind
an
improbable
legacy
as
the
only
president
in
American
history
to
serve
two
complete
terms
with
the
nation
at

.
”
This
is
a
record
seemingly
impossible
to
surpass
.
I’m
not
so
sure
