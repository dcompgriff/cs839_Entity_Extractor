Car
bombs
and
rocket
fire
shook
Aleppo
on
Saturday
as
rebels
battled
to
break
a
siege
by
the
Syrian
government
,
which
launched
a
counteroffensive
under
cover
of
air
strikes
,
trying
to
retake
areas
they
had
lost
to
rebels
the
day
before
,
activists
and
state
media
said
.

The
government
said
it
had
pushed
back
an
attack
on
the
south
and
west
of
the
city
,
but
the
rebels
and
the
Britain
-
based
Syrian
Observatory
for
Human
Rights
,
a
monitoring
group
,
said
rebels
had
taken
control
of
an
entire
suburb
in
the
southwest
corner
of
Aleppo
,
VOA
reported
.

The
offensive
,
launched
on
Friday
,
aims
to
break
through
a
three
-
month
encirclement
of
the
battered
city's
eastern
districts
,
where
more
than
250
,
000
people
live
without
access
to
food
or
humanitarian
aid
.

"
In
just
a
few
days
,
we
will
open
the
way
for
our
besieged
brothers
,
"
rebel
commander
Abu
Mustafa
told
AFP
from
the
frontline
district
of
Dahiyet
al
-
Assad
,
on
the
southwestern
outskirts
of
Aleppo

Fighting
and
air
strikes
pounded
nearly
all
of
Aleppo's
western
outskirts
,
with
the
most
intense
clashes
reported
in
the
districts
of
al
-
Zahraa
and
Dahiyet
al
-
Assad
.

Yasser
al
-
Youssef
of
the
Noureddin
al
-
Zinki
rebel
faction
said
opposition
fighters
opened
a
new
front
in
al
-
Zahraa
on
Saturday
with
a
massive
car
bombing
.

The
Syrian
Observatory
for
Human
Rights
monitoring
group
said
rebels
and
allied
militants
have
unleashed
a
barrage
of
rocket
fire
and
at
least
10
car
bombs
since
their
assault
began
.

The
Britain
-
based
group
said
two
days
of
fighting
had
killed
at
least
30
government
forces
and
allied
fighters
as
well
as
26
Syrian
rebels
,
but
it
did
not
give
a
toll
for
foreign
militants
battling
alongside
the
opposition
.

At
least
21
civilians
,
including
two
children
,
have
been
killed
in
rebel
bombardment
since
Friday
morning
.

Syrian
state
news
agency
SANA
said
rockets
fired
by
opposition
groups
on
Saturday
wounded
six
people
including
a
child
in
two
government
-
held
districts
.

The
offensive
has
seen
more
than
1
,
500
rebels
from
the
provinces
of
Aleppo
and
nearby
Idlib
amass
along
a
front
stretching
for
15km
down
the
city's
western
edges
.

Their
aim
is
to
work
their
way
east
through
a
sprawling
military
complex
,
then
to
the
district
of
al
-
Hamdaniyeh
to
break
through
government
lines
.

Fighting
on
Saturday
was
so
fierce
around
al
-
Zahraa
and
Dahiyet
al
-
Assad
that
the
explosions
and
gunfire
could
be
heard
across
Aleppo's
eastern
half
,
AFP's
correspondent
there
said
.

"
There
have
not
been
clashes
this
intense
in
al
-
Zahraa
since
2012
,
"
when
opposition
fighters
seized
Aleppo's
east
,
said
Observatory
head
Rami
Abdel
Rahman
.

He
said
the
pro
-
government
forces’
counterattack
on
Saturday
had
managed
to
recapture
several
positions
in
Dahiyet
al
-
Assad
,
where
rebels
had
scored
a
major
advance
.

An
AFP
correspondent
who
visited
the
district
saw
deserted
streets
and
extensive
damage
to
buildings
battered
by
air
strikes
and
artillery
fire
.

Syria's
second
city
Aleppo
has
been
devastated
by
some
of
the
heaviest
fighting
of
the
country's
five
-
year
civil
war
that
began
with
anti
-
government
protests
and
has
since
killed
more
than
300
,
000
people
.

Much
of
the
once
-
bustling
economic
hub
has
been
reduced
to
rubble
by
air
and
artillery
bombardment
,
including
barrel
bombs
-
crude
unguided
explosive
devices
that
cause
indiscriminate
damage
.

Last
week
,
Russia
implemented
a
three
-
day
"
humanitarian
truce
"
intended
to
allow
civilians
and
surrendering
rebels
to
leave
the
east
,
but
few
did
so
.

Russia
,
whose
intervention
in
September
2015
with
air
strikes
in
support
of
President
Bashar
al
-
Assad's
forces
was
seen
as
a
game
-
changer
,
says
it
has
not
bombed
Aleppo
since
18
October
.

The
Observatory
said
on
Saturday
that
Russian
raids
have
been
battering
Aleppo's
western
battlefronts
,
but
it
confirmed
that
the
halt
to
Moscow's
aerial
bombing
of
the
city
itself
was
holding
.

The
Russian
military
said
on
Friday
it
had
asked
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
authorisation
to
resume
the
raids
.

But
Kremlin
spokesman
Dmitry
Peskov
said
Putin
"
considers
it
inappropriate
at
the
current
moment
,
"
adding
that
the
president
thought
it
necessary
to
"
continue
the
humanitarian
pause
"
in
Aleppo
.

The
United
States
on
Friday
accused
the
government
of
using
starvation
as
a
weapon
of
war
-
a
war
crime
under
the
Geneva
Conventions
.

Rejecting
Kremlin
claims
that
attacks
on
Aleppo
have
stopped
,
a
US
official
told
AFP
that
"
the
regime
has
rejected
UN
requests
to
deliver
aid
to
eastern
Aleppo
-
using
starvation
as
a
weapon
of
war
"
.

Aleppo's
front
line
runs
through
the
heart
of
the
city
,
dividing
rebels
in
the
east
from
government
troops
in
the
west
.

It
lies
at
the
crossroads
of
key
transport
routes
,
making
it
a
strategic
prize
for
both
sides
and
a
potential
bargaining
chip
for
both
opposition
and
government
forces
if
UN
-
brokered
peace
talks
are
resumed
.
