Have
you
read
The
Peanut
Allergy
Epidemic
by
historian
Heather
Fraser
?
She
begins
by
asking
us
why
the
peanut
allergy
epidemic
is
only
found
in
Western
cultures
,
where
at
least
4
million
people
experience
the
mysterious
phenomenon
,
yet
there
are
virtually
no
reported
cases
in
India
,
where
peanuts
just
so
happen
to
be
the
main
ingredient
in
most
baby
food
products
.
Consider
this:
one
century
ago
,
you
couldn't
find
anyone
allergic
to
peanuts
,
but
now
it's
commonplace
for
parents
to
send
EpiPens
to
school
for
the
teacher
and
nurse
to
keep
near
to
their
children
,
just
in
case
someone
so
much
as
opens
a
snack
in
the
room
that
contains
peanuts
,
or
even
if
someone
opens
a
food
product
that
was
so
much
as
manufactured
in
"
a
facility
that
processes
peanuts
.
"
What's
wrong
with
the
human
body
that
it
would
go
into
anaphylactic
shock
from
a
seemingly
harmless
food
ingredient
that
couldn't
harm
a
soul
a
hundred
years
ago
?
Today
,
peanuts
cause
the
most
common
severe
food
allergy
reactions
,
and
are
the
number
one
cause
of
death
from
food
reactions
,
and
for
good
reason:
Peanut
oil
was
never
meant
to
be
put
in
a
syringe
and
injected
into
muscle
tissue
.
Peanut
oil
is
a
non
-
stated
,
hidden
ingredient
in
children's
vaccines
Back
in
2010
,
one
family
had
their
6
-
month
-
old
child
taken
away
from
them
and
were
accused
in
court
of
shaken
baby
syndrome
,
until
their
attorney
presented
corroborating
medical
information
about
the
child's
anaphylactic
reaction
and
swelling
around
the
baby
boy's
brain
(
subdural
hemorrhages
)
that
occurred
as
an
immediate
response
to
vaccinations
.
Which
vaccines
were
those
,
you
may
be
wondering
?
DTaP
,
Prevnar7
(
pneumococcal
)
and
Rotateq
(
Rotavirus
vaccine
)
.
Guess
what
?
The
administered
vaccines
contained
unlabeled
peanut
oil
,
which
was
used
as
an
adjuvant
,
but
was
not
listed
on
the
vaccine
inserts
.
The
doctor
basically
proved
to
the
court
that
the
child's
allergic
reaction
to
having
peanut
oil
injected
by
vaccine
had
caused
the
massive
brain
swelling
reaction
that
sent
the
boy
into
shock
.
False
medical
theory:
The
stronger
the
allergic
reaction
to
vaccine
ingredients
,
the
longer
the
immunity
lasts
In
the
mid
-
1960s
,
peanut
oils
were
first
introduced
into
vaccines
because
scientists
hypothesized
they
could
"
prolong
"
immunity
.
Somehow
,
they
thought
,
the
oil
would
act
as
a
time
release
capsule
.
Within
20
years
,
peanut
oil
was
the
preferred
"
excipient
"
–
meaning
a
substance
formulated
alongside
the
active
ingredient
of
a
medication
for
the
purpose
of
long
-
term
stabilization
.
The
dangers
of
its
use
,
however
,
were
well
-
documented
.
The
problem
?
Doctors
and
scientists
had
lumped
immune
response
with
immunity
,
making
a
grave
mistake
that's
still
assumed
to
be
true
today
.
The
myth
is
that
the
greater
the
allergic
response
to
the
vaccine
,
the
greater
the
immunity
that
is
conferred
.
Wrong
!
Today
,
anyone
who
challenges
this
myth
is
referred
to
as
anti
-
science
,
anti
-
vaccine
and
a
conspiracy
theorist
.
There
is
no
faster
way
for
a
doctor
to
lose
their
license
to
practice
medicine
than
to
challenge
this
commandment
of
vaccine
mythology
.
1980
to
2016:
Correlating
the
massive
surge
in
severe
childhood
allergies
When
did
these
childhood
allergies
experience
a
massive
upsurge
in
number
?
Answer:
When
the
mandated
schedule
of
the
number
and
frequency
of
vaccines
for
children
under
age
7
doubled
,
and
then
tripled
.
Take
a
look:
1980
–
20
vaccines
1995
–
40
vaccines
2016
–
70
vaccines
What's
the
easiest
way
to
send
a
child's
body
into
anaphylactic
shock
and
create
severe
food
allergies
for
the
rest
of
his/her
life
?
Inject
intact
proteins
from
peanuts
,
eggs
and
dairy
(
casein
)
products
directly
into
the
infant's
muscle
tissue
36
times
before
the
age
of
18
months
.
When
normal
food
becomes
extremely
toxic
to
children
,
the
parents
should
review
how
those
specific
ingredients
have
been
introduced
to
their
infant's
bodies
,
and
what
other
dangerous
"
trace
amounts
"
of
carcinogens
,
antibiotics
,
adjuvants
,
emulsifiers
,
preservatives
,
additives
,
brewing
agents
,
carriers
and
"
immune
response
stimulants
"
are
being
injected
into
the
body
repeatedly
for
no
logical
reason
.
Vaccines
have
never
been
proven
safe
or
effective
;
only
studies
done
by
the
manufacturers
themselves
,
which
have
subsequently
been
proven
fraudulent
,
altered
and
skewed
,
are
published
in
order
to
fool
the
public
.
Do
you
really
know
what's
in
most
vaccines
?
Have
you
ever
read
the
ingredients
,
warnings
,
reactions
and
the
documented
side
effects
on
a
vaccine
insert
?
Here
is
a
summary
of
the
most
dangerous
vaccine
ingredients
,
for
your
convenience:
1
.
Bovine
cow
serum:
Extracted
from
cow
skin
.
When
injected
causes
connective
tissue
disorders
,
arthritis
and
lupus
;
also
shortness
of
breath
,
low
blood
pressure
,
chest
pain
and
skin
reactions
.
2
.
Sorbitol:
Synthetic
sweetener
which
metabolizes
very
slowly
and
aggravates
IBS
and
gastrointestinal
issues
.
3
.
Hydrolyzed
gelatin:
Derived
from
the
collagen
inside
animals'
skin
and
bones
.
Injecting
gelatin
poses
the
risk
of
infection
from
synthetic
growth
hormones
and
BSE
infectivity
(
mad
cow
disease
)
.
4
.
Sodium
chloride:
Raises
blood
pressure
and
inhibits
muscle
contraction
and
growth
.
5
.
Egg
protein:
Vaccines
are
prepared
in
eggs
(
certainly
not
organic
)
.
May
contain
growth
hormones
,
antibiotics
,
and
salmonella
bacteria
.
6
.
Casein:
Also
known
as
cow's
milk
protein
,
many
children
experience
severe
allergic
and
life
-
threatening
reactions
to
traces
of
casein
,
commonly
found
in
the
DTaP
vaccine
.
7
.
Thimerosal:
A
neurotoxic
mercury
which
causes
autism:
There
are
25
mcg
in
one
average
flu
vaccine
,
and
the
<[>EPA<]>
safety
limit
is
5
micrograms
,
so
children
who
are
vaccinated
simultaneously
with
multiple
vaccines
receive
over
10
times
the
safety
limit
of
mercury
in
one
day
.
8
.
Human
albumin:
The
protein
portion
of
blood
from
pooled
human
venous
plasma
;
when
injected
causes
fever
,
chills
,
hives
,
rash
,
headache
,
nausea
,
breathing
difficulty
,
and
rapid
heart
rate
.
9
.
Formaldehyde:
Highly
carcinogenic
fluid
used
to
embalm
corpses
.
Ranked
one
of
the
most
hazardous
compounds
to
human
health
;
can
cause
liver
damage
,
gastrointestinal
issues
,
reproductive
deformation
,
respiratory
distress
and
cancer
.
