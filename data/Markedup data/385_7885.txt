Oregano
oil
is
the
ultimate
antibiotic
.
Oregano
is
a
powerful
herb
with
unique
healing
properties
.
Did
you
know
that
oregano
has
eight
times
more
antioxidants
than
apples
and
three
times
as
much
as
blueberries
?
Antioxidants
are
needed
to
protect
our
body
against
free
radical
damage
.
They
boost
the
immune
-
system
naturally
.
Oregano
Oil
is
the
most
potent
plant
oil
in
the
world
!
The
distribution
of
oregano
oil
started
in
Ancient
Greece
.
In
Greek
the
word
oregano
is
translated
as
joy
of
the
mountains
.
The
Greeks
were
first
to
use
oil
for
medicinal
purposes
,
such
as
a
powerful
antiviral
,
antibacterial
,
antiseptic
,
antifungal
agent
and
also
as
a
remedy
for
pain
,
and
inflammation
.
It
was
the
main
antibacterial
tool
used
by
Hippocrates
.
Oregano
leaves
were
traditionally
used
to
treat
illnesses
related
to
the
respiratory
and
digestive
systems
.
Oregano
Oil
is
The
Ultimate
Antibiotic

Main
Ingredients:
Oregano
Essential
Oil
is
a
mineral
density
powerhouse
.
It
contains
calcium
,
magnesium
,
zinc
,
iron
,
potassium
,
copper
,
boron
,
manganese
,
vitamins
C
,
A
(
beta
-
carotene
)
,
Niacin
.
Oregano
oil
contains
four
main
groups
of
chemicals
which
are
active
healing
agents
.

Phenols
including
carvacrol
and
thymol
.
They
act
as
antiseptics
and
antioxidants
.
Terpenes
including
pinene
and
terpinene
.
They
possess
antiseptic
,
antiviral
,
anti
-
inflammatory
and
anesthetic
properties
.
Linalool
and
bonreol
are
two
long
-
chain
alcohols
found
in
oregano
oil
.
They
exhibit
antiviral
and
antiseptic
properties
.
Esters
include
linalyl
acetate
and
geranyl
acetate
.
They
exhibit
antifungal
properties
.
Although
all
these
compounds
possess
healing
properties
,
the
most
significant
primary
compound
found
in
oregano
oil
is
carvacrol
.
Scientific
research
has
proved
carvacrol
to
be
one
of
the
most
effective
antibiotics
known
to
science
.
Not
All
Oregano
Oil
is
Created
Equal

Real
wild
Mediteranean
Oregano
needs
to
be
either
of
origanum
vulgare
kind
,
or
Thymus
capitatus
,
which
mostly
grows
in
Spain
.
It
is
very
important
to
make
sure
the
Oil
of
Oregano
is
derived
from
these
two
kinds
.
It
also
has
to
have
the
carvacrol
concentration
of
70
%
or
more
.
Most
importantly
,
oregano
essential
oil
does
not
create
harmful
strains
in
the
body
and
does
not
have
side
effects
the
pharmaceutical
antibiotics
do
.
Moreover
,
it
is
effective
against
a
dangerous
and
even
deadly
bacteria
,
but
does
not
produce
biological
changes
in
the
body
.
Oregano
essential
oil
nourishes
the
body
and
doesn’t
deplete
it
of
nutrients
like
conventional
antibiotics
do
.
And
if
you
look
at
the
statistics
,
people
in
the
Mediterranean
live
longer
for
the
most
part
.
Maybe
partly
because
of
oregano
which
is
added
to
most
Mediterranean
dishes
!
