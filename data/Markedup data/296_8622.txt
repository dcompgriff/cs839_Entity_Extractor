As late as Monday evening the Huffington Post was 98%+ certain that Hillary Clinton would win the Presidency.
Turns out they may have been off… by a lot.
With Florida leaning towards Trump and 92% of the votes already counted, what was a sure thing suddenly isn’t.
Michigan remains in play and the mainstream media reports that the Clinton campaign still thinks they have a good chance at taking the state. Pennsylvania, though only a small percentage of votes have been counted, is already being projected for Hillary.
As we noted earlier today, Trump needs to win two states out of Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan to take the electoral map.
The Huffington Post is freaking out, headlining their page with “This Is Getting Scary.”
As Matt Drudge noted earlier at his web site, the election will come down to the late evening voters, many of whom were unable to cast votes until they got out of work.
