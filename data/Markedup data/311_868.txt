At
least
5
,
561
people
were
killed
and
2
,
463
were
wounded
across
Iraq
during
October
.
These
figures
are
estimates
,
perhaps
even
conservative
ones
.
Breaking
down
the
above
numbers
,
we
find
that
1
,
629
civilians
were
killed
,
and
1
,
693
were
injured
.
At
least
303
security
personnel
were
also
killed
,
and
660
more
were
wounded
in
fighting
.
Militants
lost
an
estimated
3
,
611
members
,
while
108
more
are
known
to
have
been
wounded
.
Again
,
these
are
very
rough
estimates
.
Also
,
one
U
.
S
.
soldier
was
killed
,
and
at
least
two
French
soldiers
were
wounded
during
October
.
Turkish
airstrikes
left
at
least
17
Kurdistan
Workers
Party
(
P
.
K
.
K
.
)
guerrillas
dead
as
well
.
These
figures
are
much
higher
than
they
were
in
September
due
to
a
massive
operation
that
was
launched
against
the
city
of
Mosul
.
Last
month
only
2
,
824
people
were
killed
and
1
,
208
were
wounded
.
Due
to
the
nature
of
the
fighting
in
Iraq
,
accurate
numbers
may
be
impossible
to
obtain
.
The
Iraqi
government
has
been
tight
with
releasing
casualty
statements
concerning
security
personnel
.
On
the
other
hand
,
authorities
may
be
too
loose
with
figures
detailing
militant
losses
.
Those
figures
may
also
represent
civilian
losses
counted
as
military
.
