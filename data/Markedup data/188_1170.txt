News
and
Adventure
from
<[>Glacier
National
Park<]>
After
surprising
and
then
being
charged
by
a
grizzly
bear
,
a
couple
fishing
along
the
Lamar
River
effectively
deployed
their
bear
spray
and
saved
themselves
from
injury
on
Saturday
,
October
22
.
John
and
Lisa
Vandenbos
from
Bozeman
,
MT
,
parked
at
a
pullout
near
the
Specimen
Ridge
trailhead
in
the
Lamar
Valley
,
east
of
Tower
Junction
.
They
walked
cross
-
country
to
the
Lamar
River
and
,
while
scouting
for
fishing
spots
,
surprised
an
adult
grizzly
bear
who
was
feeding
on
a
partially
consumed
carcass
.
The
bear
immediately
charged
the
couple
and
came
within
nine
feet
when
both
individuals
quickly
discharged
their
bear
spray
.
The
bear
initially
left
.
When
attempting
to
charge
the
couple
again
,
it
ran
into
the
original
cloud
of
bear
spray
.
Upon
making
contact
with
the
cloud
,
the
bear
retreated
all
the
way
back
across
the
river
and
up
the
adjacent
hillside
“as
fast
as
it
could
go”
.
The
couple
did
not
sustain
injuries
and
bear
spray
stopped
the
charging
bear
.
The
couple
left
the
area
immediately
and
returned
to
their
vehicle
.
They
then
reported
the
incident
to
a
park
ranger
.
Park
rangers
do
not
intend
to
search
for
the
bear
since
this
incident
was
a
surprise
encounter
with
a
bear
defending
its
carcass
.
All
of
<[>Yellowstone
National
Park<]>
is
bear
country
.
Reduce
your
risk
of
a
bear
encounter
by
carrying
bear
spray
.
Studies
show
that
bear
spray
is
more
than
90
percent
effective
in
stopping
an
aggressive
bear
.
In
fact
,
it
is
the
most
effective
deterrent
when
used
in
combination
with
regular
safety
recommendations
–
be
alert
,
make
noise
,
hike
in
groups
of
three
or
more
,
do
not
run
if
you
encounter
a
bear
and
stand
your
ground
if
charged
by
a
bear
.
“Yellowstone
visitors
care
deeply
about
preserving
bears
and
observing
them
in
the
wild
,
”
says
Kerry
Gunther
,
the
park’s
Bear
Management
Specialist
.
“Carrying
bear
spray
is
the
best
way
for
visitors
to
participate
in
bear
conservation
because
reducing
potential
conflicts
protects
both
people
and
bears
.
”
Help
the
park
increase
the
number
of
visitors
who
carry
bear
spray
and
know
how
to
use
it
.
