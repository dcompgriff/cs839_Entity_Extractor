“Faced
with
the
choice
between
changing
one’s
mind
and
proving
that
there
is
no
need
to
do
so,
almost
everybody
gets
busy
on
the
proof.”

Last
month,
tensions
between
dark
matter
simulations
and
galactic
rotation
observations
reached
a
new
high.
Despite
all
the
successes
of
dark
matter
on
the
largest
scales
—
for
the
CMB,
for
large-scale
structure,
for
gravitational
lensing
and
for
galaxy
clusters,
among
others
—
the
simplest
dark
matter
simulations
reproduced
unrealistic
results
for
how
individual
galaxies
ought
to
rotate.
Moreover,
a
team
of
scientists
uncovered
a
surprising
relationship:
between
the
normal
(baryonic)
matter
alone
and
the
observed
acceleration
in
galaxies.
The
correlation
between
gravitational
acceleration
(y-axis)
and
the
normal,
baryonic
matter
(x-axis)
visible
in
an
assembly
of
153
galaxies.

the

binned
data.

If
dark
matter
were
real,
then
the
simulations
needed
to
reproduce
that
result
as
well,
which
appeared
to
be
a
tremendous
challenge.
Yet
in
a
new
paper,
two
scientists
from
McMaster
University,
Ben
Keller
and
James
Wadsley,
did
exactly
this.
Even
more
impressively,
they
didn’t
make
new
simulations,
they
simply
took
pre-existing
ones
and
showed
that
this
relation
does,
in
fact,
get
reproduced
among
all
their
galaxies.
While
the
web
of
dark
matter
(purple)
might
seem
to
determine
cosmic
structure
formation
on
its
own,
the
feedback
from
normal
matter
(red)
can
severely
impact
galactic
scales.

If
the
modified
gravity
camp
through
down
the
gauntlet,
the
dark
matter
camp
just
revealed
they
had
brought
a
bazooka
to
a
gunfight.
