Dispatches
from
STEPHEN
LENDMAN
H
illary
and
others
irresponsibly
accused
Russia
for
the
damning
leaked
emails
–
aiming
to
distract
attention
from
her
wrongdoing
.
Sputnik
News
interviewed
former
UK
ambassador
to
Uzbekistan
Craig
Murray
.
He
explained
“
(
t
)
he
source
of
these
emails
and
leaks
has
nothing
to
do
with
Russia
at
all
.
”

“I
discovered
what
the
source
was
when
I
attended
the
Sam
Adam’s
whistleblower
award
in
Washington
,
”
he
explained
.
“The
source
of
these
emails
comes
from
within
official
circles
in
Washington
DC
.
You
should
look
to
Washington
not
to
Moscow…
WikiLeaks
has
never
published
any
material
received
from
the
Russian
government
or
from
any
proxy
of
the
Russian
government
.
It’s
simply
a
completely
untrue
claim
designed
to
divert
attention
from
the
content
of
the
material
.
”

The
pieces
are
in
place
to
assure
a
Hillary
victory
on
Tuesday
.
But
the
system
is
now
so
broken
due
to
rifts
inside
the
ruling
class
,
that
surprises
might
be
inevitable
.

Hillary
,
campaign
aides
,
DNC
officials
and
media
scoundrel
press
agents
irresponsibly
blame
Russia
working
collaboratively
with
Trump
.
The
Big
Lie
repeated
enough
gets
most
people
to
believe
it
.
Given
Hillary’s
unpopularity
,
maybe
the
tactic
is
less
effective
in
her
case
.
Whistleblower
insiders
uncover
important
information
everyone
has
a
right
to
know
.
They
leak
it
to
sources
like
WikiLeaks
.
Julian
Assange
and
others
working
with
him
then
publish
it
–
including
a
treasure
trove
of
damning
Hillary
and
Podesta
emails
.
…
Will
it
make
a
difference
next
Tuesday
?
Not
if
things
are
rigged
for
her
as
Trump
claims
.
If
he
loses
and
challenges
the
outcome
,
things
could
get
pretty
dicey
ahead
.
