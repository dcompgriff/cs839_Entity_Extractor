Bread
and
Circuses

A
phrase
used
by
a
Roman
writer
to
deplore
the
declining
heroism
of
Romans
after
the
Roman
Republic
ceased
to
exist
and
the
Roman
Empire
began:
“Two
things
only
the
people
anxiously
desire
—
bread
and
circuses
.
”
The
government
kept
the
Roman
populace
happy
by
distributing
free
food
and
staging
huge
spectacles
.

So
,
(
S
)
election
is
part
of
the
Circuses…
You
should
worry
when
the
Free
food
distribution
increases
.
