UK POLICE have renewed their appeal for any information as to the whereabouts of a French national who was reported missing in the Manchester area of the country in August, WWN can reveal. 
“Paul Pogba was last seen in Turin and believed to have boarded a plane to Manchester to start a new job, but his employers reported he failed to turn up to work in August. We are renewing our appeal for anyone with information to come forward,” Met officer John Goodwin shared as part of the appeal. 
Officers would not be drawn on the rumours that the man had robbed his employers of his salary and signing on bonus before disappearing. 
“Paul also answers to ‘Pog’ and in addition to being able to play in all variety of positions he would be easily identified by his haircut, which looks like it was done by a blind man with a great sense of humour,” officer Goodwin added. 
Police hope that with his employers Manchester United being back in the headlines recently following a mixed run of form, they can use the publicity surrounding it to find Paul safe and sound. 
“Just come home, Paul,” Pogba’s emotional manager Jose Mourinho urged as part of the renewed search appeal. 
One of the UK’s most intriguing missing persons inquiry ever, Mr. Pogba’s absence has sparked what experts have called mass hallucinations as members of the public claim to have seen him on television on multiple occasions. 
Police hopes were dashed last week when they rushed to London’s Chelsea area last Sunday after sightings of the man were reported but a search of the location proved otherwise.
