FRANCE
:
Police
are
under
siege
in
Muslim
migrant
areas
in
and
around
Paris
,
also
known
as
“
NO
-
GO
Zones
”
Despite
President
Francois
Hollande’s
continued
insistence
that
there
aren’t
any
Muslim
NO
-
GO
Zones
in
France
,
police
say
otherwise
.
NO
-
GO
Zones
are
violent
and
lawless
Muslim
migrant
dominated
neighborhoods
around
Paris
that
are
virtually
off
limits
to
non
-
Muslims
and
a
threat
to
police
and
firefighters
.

There
is
a
mountain
of
evidence
that
confirms
the
existence
of
Muslim
‘
NO
GO
ZONES’
(
Zones
Urbaines
Sensibles
)
where
non
-
Muslims
are
afraid
to
go
because
they
regularly
are
attacked
by
gangs
of
Muslims
who
rule
these
lawless
neighborhoods
.
Host
-
country
authorities
have
effectively
lost
control
over
many
no
-
go
zones
and
are
often
unable
or
unwilling
to
provide
even
basic
public
aid
,
such
as
police
,
fire
fighting
and
ambulance
services
,
out
of
fear
of
being
attacked
by
Muslim
youth
.
Muslim
enclaves
in
European
cities
are
also
breeding
grounds
for
Islamic
radicalism
and
pose
a
significant
threat
to
Western
security
.
Europe’s
no
-
go
zones
are
the
by
-
product
of
decades
of
multicultural
policies
that
have
encouraged
Muslim
immigrants
to
create
parallel
societies
and
remain
segregated
from
—
rather
than
become
integrated
into
—
their
European
host
nations
.
A

research
paper
entitled
“
No
-
Go
Zones
in
the
French
Republic
:
Myth
or
Reality
?
”
documented
dozens
of
French
neighborhoods
“
where
police
and
gendarmerie
cannot
enforce
the
Republican
order
or
even
enter
without
risking
confrontation
,
projectiles
,
or
even
fatal
shootings
.

A
landmark
2
,
200
-
page
report
,
“
Banlieue
de
la
République
”
(
Suburbs
of
the
Republic
)
found
that
<[>Seine
-
Saint
-
Denis<]>
and
other
Parisian
suburbs
are
becoming
“
separate
Islamic
societies
”
cut
off
from
the
French
state
,
and
where
Islamic
Sharia
law
is
rapidly
displacing
French
civil
law
.
The
report
said
that
Muslim
immigrants
are
increasingly
rejecting
French
values
and
instead
are
immersing
themselves
in
literal
violent
Islam
.
The
problem
of
no
-
go
zones
is
well
documented
,
but
multiculturalists
and
their
politically
correct
supporters
vehemently
deny
that
they
exist
.
Some
are
now
engaged
in
a
concerted
campaign
to
discredit
and
even
silence
those
who
draw
attention
to
the
issue
.

In
October
2011
,
a
2
,
200
-
page
report
,
“
Banlieue
de
la
République
”
(
Suburbs
of
the
Republic
)
found
that
<[>Seine

and

are
becoming
“

cut
off
from
the
French
state
and
where
Islamic
Sharia
law
is
rapidly
displacing
French
civil
law
.
The
report
also
showed
how
the
problem
is
being
exacerbated
by
radical
Muslim
preachers
who
are
promoting
the
social
marginalization
of
Muslim
immigrants
in
order
to
create
a
parallel
Muslim
society
in
France
that
is
ruled
by
Sharia
law
.
The
television
presenter
asks
:
“
What
if
we
went
to
the
suburbs
?
”
Obertone
replies
:
“
I
do
not
recommend
this
.
Not
even
we
French
dare
go
there
anymore
.
But
nobody
talks
about
this
in
public
,
of
course
.
Nor
do
those
who
claim
,
‘
long
live
multiculturalism
,
’
and
‘
Paris
is
wonderful
!
’
dare
enter
the
suburbs
.
”
Back
in
2015
,
the
Mayor
of
Paris
threatened
to
sue
<[>FOX
News<]>
for
reporting
on
the
problem
of
Muslim
NO
-
GO
Zones
.
As
a
result
,
several
<[>FOX<]>
commentators
were
forced
to
issue
apologies
on
the
air
for
claiming
after
the
<[>Charlie
Hebdo<]>
attack
that
there
are
Muslim
-
ruled
“
no
-
go
zones
”
in
France
.
