Greens
Question
Trump’s
Victory
November
24,
2016

A
sudden
flood
of
cash
has
enabled
the
Green
Party
to
demand
recounts
of
votes
in
Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania
and
Michigan,
three
formerly
Democratic
states
that
largely
decided
the
2016
election
for
Donald
Trump,
reports

Lauria.

The
Green
Party
is
demanding
a
recount
of
votes
in
three
key
states
that
could
potentially
affect
the
outcome
of
the
election
that
saw
Donald
Trump
chosen
as
president.
The
party
was
able
to
raise
$2.5
million
needed
to
at
least
pay
for
the
recount
in
Wisconsin
in
less
than
12
hours
from
the
time
the
Greens’
intentions
were
reported
by
the
media
on
Wednesday.

Jill
Stein,
leader
of
the
party
that
received
less
than
1
percent
of
the
national
vote,
said
in
a
press
release
that
the
Greens
wanted
the
recount
“because
reported
hacks
into
voter
and
party
databases
and
individual
email
accounts
are
causing
many
Americans
to
wonder
if
our
election
results
are
reliable.”

The
Green
Party
wants
recounts
in
Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania
and
Michigan
–
the
three
states
that
effectively
determined
the
result
of
the
presidential
race
by
slipping
from
the
Democratic
column
in
2012.
The
deadline
to
file
for
a
recount
is
Friday
in
Wisconsin,
Monday
in
Pennsylvania
and
Wednesday
in
Michigan.

The
cost
of
the
Wisconsin
recount
is
$1.1
million,
according
to
the
Green
Party
press
release
.
The
release
does
not
say
what
the
cost
for
all
three
recounts
is,
but
the
party
initially
sought
$2.5
million.
That
was
widely
reported
as
the
total
amount
needed.
But
once
that
goal
was
reached,
the
target
was
jacked
up
to
$4.5
million.

The
party’s
home
page
appeal
for
money
says
the
entire
cost
with
legal
fees
could
be
$6
million
to
$7
million.
This
statement
also
includes
a
quote
from
Stein
that
blames
“foreign
agents”
for
hacking
into
“party
databases,
private
email
servers,
and
voter
databases
in
certain
states.”
Her
quote
in
the
press
release
removed
the
words
“foreign
agents.”

Slim
Margins

Trump
narrowly
beat
Democratic
contender
Hillary
Clinton
in
Wisconsin
and
Pennsylvania
and
is
leading
in
Michigan,
which
more
than
two
weeks
later
is
still
too
close
to
call.
Just
a
55,000-vote
swing
is
all
that
is
needed
in
the
three
states
to
flip
the
election
to
Clinton.

On
Tuesday
it
was
reported
that
a
group
of
U.S.
professors
–
computer
scientists
and
elections
lawyers
–
had
held
a
conference
call
with
the
Clinton
campaign
to
ask
it
to
file
for
an
audit
in
the
three
states.
They
said
that
actual
results
differed
from
exit
polls
and
that
Trump
had
done
considerably
better
in
areas
where
electronic
voting
machines
were
used.
Clinton
did
better
where
paper
ballots
were
used.

Party
presidential
candidate
Jill
Stein.

Some
experts
explained
that
electronic
machines
were
used
in
rural
areas,
which
were
stronger
for
Trump,
while
paper
ballots
were
used
in
urban
areas
largely
backing
Clinton.

The
academics
lobbying
the
Clinton
campaign
have
suggested
that
a
foreign
government
may
be
behind
the
hacks.
The
Obama
administration
had
said
before
the
election
that
Russia
was
trying
to
influence
the
election
through
hacking,
though
no
evidence
was
made
public.

In
his
final
testimony
to
Congress
last
week,
outgoing
Director
of
National
Intelligence
James
Clapper
admitted
that
there
was
no
proof
about
who
was
behind
the
supposed
hacks
into
email
accounts
of
Democratic
leaders
which
proved
embarrassing
to
the
Clinton
campaign.

The
Clinton
campaign
has
made
no
statement
about
the
recount.
But
many
Clinton
supporters
have
backed
the
effort
online.
The
Trump
transition
team
has
made
no
comment.

Trump
won
the
Electoral
College
vote
290
to
232,
with
Michigan’s
16
electoral
votes
still
outstanding
and
with
270
votes
needed
to
be
elected
President.
Clinton
won
the
national
popular
vote
by
about
2
million
votes.

The
Green’s
Motive

Because
of
Clinton’s
popular-vote
plurality,
there
have
been
calls
for
electors
from
states
that
voted
for
Trump
to
change
their
vote
to
Clinton,
but
there
is
no
indication
that
Trump’s
electors
are
switching
sides.
Twenty-four
states
do
not
legally
bind
electors
to
vote
with
the
popular
will
of
their
states.
The
electors
will
vote
in
their
state
capitals
on
Dec.
19.
The
Congress
will
certify
the
election
on
Jan.
6.

The
move
by
the
Greens
raises
many
questions.
At
face
value,
they
say
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
system
is
the
only
thing
at
stake.
But
the
Greens
must
know
that
the
recount
effort
could
only
help
Clinton
and
hurt
Trump.

Is
there
some
collusion
between
the
Democratic
Party
and
the
Greens?
Are
they
a
Trojan
horse
for
Clinton
who
can
stay
above
the
fray
while
getting
the
recount
that
some
of
her
supporters
have
called
for?

Have
wealthy
Clinton
donors
been
behind
the
flood
of
cash
into
the
effort
in
so
short
a
time?
Or
are
the
Greens
sincere
in
wanting
voting
irregularities
exposed?
One
theory
is
that
the
recount
will
expose
cheating
by
both
the
Republicans
and
Democrats
–
and
thus
reflect
badly
on
the
two-party
system
which
has
marginalized
the
Greens
and
other
third
parties.

There’s
also
the
mystery
of
why
one
Stein
quote
mentions
“foreign
agents”
while
another
doesn’t.
In
the
waning
days
of
the
campaign,
Clinton
and
her
surrogates
attacked
Trump
by
suggesting
Russian
agents
were
conspiring
to
install
him
in
the
White
House.
Why
did
Stein,
at
least
briefly,
pick
up
that
Clinton
theme
even
though
DNI
Clapper
had
distanced
himself
from
the
accusation?

Though
there’s
widespread
doubt
among
election
experts
that
an
audit
of
the
results
in
the
three
states
will
swing
the
election
to
Clinton,
there
now
is
the
possibility
that
the
unpredictable
2016
election
might
still
have
a
few
last-minute
twists.
