The
first
seven
of
24
arrested
in
the
#
OregonStandoff
were
cleared
of
all
charges
by
a
jury
on
Thursday
.
Legal
experts
are
suggesting
Ammon
Bundy’s
10
hours
or
testimony
(
yes
,
10
)
is
what
may
have
won
the
jurors
over
.

Ammon
said
,
“
Everything
comes
from
the
Earth
and
if
[
the
government
]
can
get
control
of
the
resources
,
they
can
get
control
of
the
people
.
”
It
was
Ammon
Bundy's
10
hours
of
testimony
that
likely
won
over
jurors
,

Ammon
,
who
is
the
father
of
six
,
also
said
he
was
doing
this
for
his
children
and
his
grandchildren
and
that
Americans
need
to
“
wake
up
.
”
The
#
oregonstandoff
verdict
shows
that
sometimes
citizens
get
fed
up
with
an
abusive
fed
govt
.
Obviously
the
lesson
is
not
to
have
juries
.
