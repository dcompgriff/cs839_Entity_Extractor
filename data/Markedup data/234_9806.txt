As
public
frustration
helps
sound
the
death
knell
for
the
drug
war,
its
arbitrary
laws
and
policies
appear
even
more
absurd.
In
the
latest
inexcusable
enforcement
of
an
antiquated
law,
76-year-old
disabled
veteran
Lee
Carroll
Brooker
will
live
out
what
should
be
his
golden
years
behind
bars
—
for
simple
possession
of
cannabis.

Brooker
had
been
treating
multiple
chronic
conditions
with
cannabis
he
grew
in
his
son’s
backyard;
but
when
officials
in
Alabama
officials
discovered
the
three
dozen
plants,
they
threw
him
in
prison
for
life
—
without
the
possibility
of
parole.

Thanks
to
a
pointless
mandatory
minimum
sentencing
catchall
—
and
the
Supreme
Court’s
refusal
to
hear
his
case
this
week
—
Brooker
has
been
left
little
recourse
but
to
ultimately
die
in
jail
for
treating
his
ailments
with
a
plant.

“Alabama,
like
three
other
states,
mandates
a
life
without
parole
sentence
for
simple
possession
of
small
amounts
of
marijuana
by
people
with
certain
prior
felony
convictions
—
and
Mr.
Brooker
had
been
convicted
of
a
string
of
robberies
twenty
years
earlier
in
Florida,
crimes
for
which
he
served
ten
years
in
prison,”
The
New
York
Times
explained
.
“In
such
a
case,
the
law
doesn’t
require
prosecutors
to
prove
any
intent
to
sell
the
drug.”

Essentially,
Brooker
has
been
imprisoned
twice
for
the
same
crime
—
because
he
sought
relief
from
nature
instead
of
arguably
dangerous,
legal
and
often
lethal
pharmaceuticals,
courtesy
of
Big
Pharma.
Worse,
Alabama’s
already
irrational
law
sets
the
cutoff
in
a
case
like
this
at
2.2
pounds
(1
kilogram),
and
Brooker’s
plants
weighed
just
2.8
pounds
—
but
that
included
unusable
parts,
like
stalks
and
leaves.

Make
no
mistake
—
this
is
an
unjust
law,
an
unjust
conviction,
and
a
ridiculous
capitulation
by
the
Supreme
Court
to
Alabama’s
archaic
notion
a
nonviolent
offense
should
somehow
land
a
vet
behind
bars
for
life
and
separate
him
from
his
medicine
—
as
if
law
were
an
inflexible
monster
to
be
beholden
to,
no
matter
its
worth.

In
fact,
as
the
Times
pointed
out,
“[W]hile
the
sentence
was
mandatory,
the
prosecutor
was
not
required
to
bring
the
precise
charges
that
triggered
it.
Prosecutorial
discretion
here,
as
in
most
cases,
is
a
central
factor
in
determining
what
punishment
defendants
face.”

In
other
words,
the
prosecutor
railroaded
Brooker
over
his
personal,
medicinal
plants
—
by
choice.
Brooker,
who
joined
the
U.S.
Army
at
age
17
and
came
under
fire
in
both
Lebanon
and
the
Dominican
Republic,
eventually
rose
to
the
rank
of
sergeant
in
the
82nd
Airborne
—
where
he
was
decorated
for
infantry
service.

Vox
reported
that
even
“notoriously
conservative”
Alabama
Chief
Justice
Roy
Moore
characterized
Brooker’s
sentence
as
“excessive
and
unjustified.”
And
according
to
the
Times
,
the
judge
deciding
the
vet’s
fate
would
have
preferred
to
hand
down
a
lighter
sentence,
but
once
the
charges
had
been
brought
as
they
were,
he
was
obligated
to
enforce
the
letter
of
the
law.

Yes,
this
disabled
man
technically
broke
the
law;
but
proffering
such
a
rebuttal
rings
hollow,
if
not
cold,
considering
the
majority
of
Americans
support
cannabis
legalization.
Legality
does
not
dictate
morality.

A
growing
segment
of
officials
and
public
figures
do,
as
well,
as
The
Free
Thought
Project
reported
recently
,
more
than
1,000
police,
world
leaders,
celebrities,
and
others
signed
a
letter
calling
to
summarily
end
the
disastrous
war
on
drugs.

In
fact,
though
little
comfort
to
Brooker
now,
the
Drug
Enforcement
Agency
will
likely
downgrade
cannabis
from
its
inexplicable
Schedule
1
classification
to
Schedule
2
—
as
early
as
July
of
this
year.
Note
that
while
a
plethora
of
viable
arguments
can
be
asserted
for
rescheduling,
considering
states
with
laws
like
Alabama’s
—
and
cases
like
Brooker’s
—
the
slight
concession
by
federal
law
would
make
a
comparative,
whopping
difference.

Brooker
attempted
to
bring
his
case
before
the
highest
court
in
the
land
as
an
inarguable
violation
of
the
Constitution’s
ban
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
—
to
no
avail.
The
court’s
stonewall,
in
itself,
could
be
considered
as
much
—
in
an
increasing
number
of
states,
Brooker’s
so-called
crime
would
have
been
perfectly
legal.

For
now,
though,
it
appears
the
76-year-old
will
suffer
the
consequences
of
bad
policy,
unjustifiable
law,
and
the
cruelty
of
ostensible
authority
figures
who
were
all
just
doing
their
jobs.

Now
it

game
we
need
to

sooner

it

When

There
are
many
bad
typos
in
that
motion
pdf.
For
example,
“an
unconstitutional
law
cannot
be
inconsistent
with
a
valid
one”,
should
read,
“…cannot
be
consistent…”.

I’m
not
sure
if
he
can
appeal
at
this
point.
You
only
have
10
days
post
conviction
in
my
state.
Getting
MJ
rescheduled,
or
a
pardon
from
the
Governor
may
be
possible
solutions.
Maybe
a
1983
federal
civil
rights
violation
could
get
his
conviction
overturned.
I
dunno.

The
American
government
has
grown
so
enormously
corrupt
and
the
people
won’t
take
up
arms
against
it
like
the
constitution
tells
them
too…We
are
a
nation
of
weak
useless
bystanders..
Do
nothing
to
rock
the
unjust
laws
and
corrupt
politicians,
which
is
every
last
one
of
them,
and
LET
THE
CORRUPTION
OF
OUR
GOVERNMENT
STEAL
YOUR
RIGHTS
AND
FREEDOMS
RIGHT
OUT
FROM
UNDER
YOU…..It’s
probably
already
too
late
to
try
to
revolt
anymore…
We,
the
stupid
ignorant
lazy
people,,,
have
let
them
get
away
with
this
sooo
long
and
done
absolutely
nothing
to
stop
them..

Well,
it’s
the
country
you
fought
for.
And
you
were
probably
a
real
go
getter
in
the
war
on
drugs,
until
it
came
around
and
decided
to
bite
you
in
the
ass.
Keep
your

clean

pay
your
debts,
you’ll
be

There’s
literally
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
doing
time,
long
time
for
smoking
weed
or
getting
high.
There
are
old
people,
young
people,
veterans,
church
goers,
and
assholes.
Just
because
this
guy
is
a
vet
or
old
don’t
make
him
special.
If
you
want
to
change
a
law,
enforce
it
on
everyone
and
see
who
starts
whinning.
You
seem
to
have
a
problem
with
this
guy
doing
time
but
are
just
fine
with
some
youngster
from
the
hood
getting
25
to
life
for
slingin’
rock,
as
if
his
life
doesn’t
matter.
So
until
you
can
see
the
big
pic,
go
fuck
yourself
and
your
phony
ass
sympathy.
