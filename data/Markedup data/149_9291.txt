A
MAN
is
irritating
his
colleagues
by
being
self
-
consciously
indifferent
to
the
presidential
election
.
Tom
Booker
,
an
accounts
administrator
from
Maidstone
,
is
rising
above
the
frantic
speculation
with
an
annoyingly
philosophical
approach
like
he
is
some
sort
of
mystical
guru
.

“The
office
is
rife
with
chat
about
whether
Donald
Trump
is
going
to
annihilate
us
all
by
declaring
war
on
China
,
or
if
Hillary
Clinton
is
actually
a
robot
controlled
by
the
Illuminati
,
but
Tom
won’t
join
in
.
“He
just
gives
this
beatific
smile
and
says
something
like
‘guys
,
it’s
out
of
our
hands’
or
‘it’s
up
to
America
to
make
their
choice’
and
then
changes
the
subject
.
“He
won’t
even
join
in
with
our
misty
-
eyed
chat
about
how
much
we
admire
Barack
Obama
and
secretly
fancy
Michelle
.
“I
used
to
think
he
was
just
a
laidback
guy
,
but
his
lack
of
hysterical
overreaction
is
making
me
suspect
he
voted
for
Brexit
.
”
Booker
said:
“I
just
think
they
need
to
chill
out
.
Also
,
I
don’t
understand
politics
and
don’t
want
anyone
to
realise
.
