Hacked
Podesta
Email
Reveals
Clinton
Foundation
"Coercing"
Saudi
Billionaire
For
Millions
Of
Dollars



Just
c
all
it
the
Sheikh
shake
down...

*
*
*

In
one
of
the
more
prominent
early
Podesta
email
revelations
,
we
learned
that
Sheikh
Mohammed
Hussein
Ali
Al-'Amoudi
,
a
Saudi
Arabian
and
Ethiopian
billionaire
businessman,
whose
net
worth
was
estimated
by
Forbes
at
$8.3
billion
as
of
2016,
was
one
of
the
very
generous
donors
to
the
Clinton
Foundation...
up
to
a
point.

As
a
November
2011
email
from
Ira
Magaziner,
Vice
Chairman
and
CEO
of
the
Clinton
Health
Access
Initiative,
sent
to
John
Podesta
and
Amitabh
Desai,
Director
of
Foreign
Policy
at
the
Clinton
Foundation,
revealed,
the
"CHAI
[Clinton
Health
Access
Initiative]
would
like
to
request
that
President
Clinton
call
Sheik
Mohammed
to
thank
him
for
offering
his
plane
to
the
conference
in
Ethiopia
and
expressing
regrets
that
President
Clinton's
schedule
does
not
permit
him
to
attend
the
conference."

To
this,
the
response
by
Desai
was
a
simple
one:
"
Unless
Sheikh
Mo
has
sent
us
a
$6
million
check,
this
sounds
crazy
to
do.
"

At
this
point,
Doug
Band,
Bill
Clinton's
former
chief
advisor
and
current
president
of
the
infamous
Teneo
Holding
Doug
Band,
chimed
in
that
it
probably
is
a
good
idea:
"If
he
doesn't
do
it
Chai
will
say
he
didn't
give
the
money
bc
of
wjc"
an
assessment
which
John
Podesta
agreed
with:
"this
seems
rather
easy
and
harmless
and
not
a
big
time
sink."

*
*
*

To
be
sure,
this
exchange
suggested
that
a
substantial
amount
of
cash
had
or
was
about
to
be
exchanged
between
the
Clinton
Foundation
and
the
Saudi
"Sheikh
Mo",
as
shown
in
the
photo
below.

However,
the
details
were
missing:
the
original
email
from
Ira
Magaziner
referenced
a
specific
briefing
memo
which
contained
in
it
the
talking
points
updaing
on
the
relationship
between
the
Clinton
Foundation
and
The
Saudi
billionaire:

Now,
courtesy
of
today's
latest
Podesta
email
release,
we
have
access
to
the
missing
memo
.

The
leaked
memo
lays
out
the
facts
on
the
Clinton
Foundation
trying
to
collect
on
Sheik
Mohammed’s
overdue
donor
commitment
to
CHAI.
Notably,
the
memo
gives
the
inference
of
the
Sheik
being
shaken
down
by
the
Foundation
in
that
the
Foundation
was
demanding
an
immediate
$6
million
payment
in
return
for
WJC
attending
the
2011
International
Conference
on
AIDS
and
STIs
(ICASA)
event.
Additionally
the
Foundation
apparently
enlisted
the
assistance
of
the
US
Ambassador
to
Ethiopia
to
obtain
payments
from
the
Sheik.

The
memo
initially
lays
out
Bill
Clinton's
history
with
the
Sheik:

In
the
first
bullet
point
we
find
what
the
initial
"bid"
and
"ask"
would
be
between
WJC/CF
and
the
Saudi
billionaire:
$2
million
for
every
year
that
Bill
Clinton
visit
Ethiopia.
This,
however,
was
subsequently
changed
to
an
greement
whereby
the
Saudi
would
give
$2
million
per
year
but
without
any
reference
to
visiting
Ethiopia:

Sheik
Mohammed
approached
CHAI
in
2006
shortly
after
we
opened
an
office
in
Addis
Ababa.
He
proposed
that
he
would
give
$2
million
to
CHAI
every
year
that
YOU
visited
Ethiopia
.
We
eventually
negotiated
an
Agreement
with
his
Washington
attorney,
George
Salem,
in
which
he
agreed
to
fund
CHAI
at
a
rate
of
$2
million
per
year
for
10
years
.
They
rejected
any
proposals
to
put
a
payment
schedule
in
the
agreement,
but
dropped
any
reference
tying
the
donation
to
YOU
visiting
Ethiopia
.

The
next
bullet
lays
out
the
initial
fund
transfer
of
$2
million
in
London,
as
well
as
the
broad
terms
of
the
agreement
whose
"requirement
is
that
the
money
be
spent
within
Ethiopia."
Amusingly,
the
memo
then
notes
that
during
negotiations
the
Saudi
delegation
"rejected
our
proposal
that
some
of
the
money
could
be
used
for
global
overhead.
"

The
Agreement
was
officially
signed
at
a
meeting
in
London
in
May
2007
by
the
Sheik
and
Bruce,
after
which
the
Sheik
presented
you
with
a
a
check
for
$2
million
for
the
2007
payment.
The
Agreement
is
very
general
and
does
not
require
any
specific
proposals
from
CHAI
for
how
the
money
will
be
spent
or
any
reporting.
The
only
requirement
is
that
the
money
be
spent
within
Ethiopia.
During
negotiations
they
rejected
our
proposal
that
some
of
the
money
could
be
used
for
global
overhead.

We
then
learn
that
more
cash
transfers
took
place
in
the
coming
years,
despite
the
Sheik
having
"cash
flow
problems"
which
resulted
in
a
bulk
payment
of
$4
million
in
2010
for
missed
payments
in
2008
and
2009.

Through
2008
and
early
2009,
we
were
told
the
Sheik
was
having
some
cash
flow
problems
and
that
he
was
delaying
payments
for
many
commercial
and
philanthropic
commitments
he
had
in
Ethiopia.
In
January
2010
at
a
Foundation
donors
meeting
in
Harlem,
Ambassador
Irvin
Hicks,
one
of
the
Sheik’s
representatives
in
the
U.S.
and
a
former
Ethiopian
ambassador
appointed
by
YOU
presented
to
YOU
a
check
for
$4
million
representing
payment
for
2008
and
2009.

The
memo
then
tells
WJC
just
why
the
relationship
was
created
in
the
first
place:
"The
Sheik’s
contribution
supports
most
of
CHAI’s
activities
in
Ethiopia,
one
of
its
most
important
and
successful
country
programs."

A
section
then
follow
which
reminds
Bill
Clinton
just
who
Sheikh
Mohammed
is,
and
that
the
two
had
spent
time
together
in
his
"private
suite
at
a
nightclub
attached
to
the
Sheraton"
in
Addis
Ababa,
Ethiopia:

YOU
first
met
the
Sheik
in
July
2006
during
a
visit
to
Addis.
He
visited
your
suite
in
the
Sheraton
Hotel,
which
he
owns,
for
coffee
and
then
after
dinner
YOU
dropped
into
his
private
suite
at
a
nightclub
attached
to
the
Sheraton.
He
had
invited
YOU
there
especially
because
he
thought
you
would
enjoy
the
saxophone
player
.
You
chatted
with
the
Sheik
and
played
the
saxophone
with
the
band.
Shortly
after
this
visit
negotiations
began
in
earnest
regarding
the
$20
million
commitment
the
Sheik
has
made
to
CHAI.


YOU
met
the
Sheik
in
London
in
May,
2007,
at
which
time
the
Agreement
was
signed
and
the
first
$2
million
check
was
received.


YOU
stayed
at
the
Sheraton
in
July
2008
during
your
last
Ethiopia
visit,
but
the
Sheik
was
not
in
Ethiopia
at
the
time.
The
Sheik
donated
the
rooms
and
meals
for
the
large
party
during
an
extended
four-day
visit,
two
days
longer
than
originally
planned
because
of
aircraft
problems
.

Where
things
get
interesting
is
in
the
memo's
discussion
of
the
current
(as
of
November
2011)
situation,
in
which
we
learn
that
once
again
the
Saudi
billionaire
was
behind
on
his
payments
due
to
the
current
economic
downturn:

Once
again,
we
are
told
that
the
current
economic
down
turn
has
caused
the
Sheik
to
delay
payments
for
several
commitments.
CHAI
has
not
received
the
2010
or
2011
payments
.
We
have
contacted
both
George
Salem,
the
lawyer,
and
Ambassador
Hicks
regarding
payment.
Both
say
that
the
Sheik
will
make
the
payment
but
they
have
not
been
able
to
pinpoint
an
exact
date.

Recent
complications
did
not
make
matters
any
easier,
although
the
Sheikh
had
enough
cash
to
provide
Bill
with
a
plane
to
attend
the
upcoming
African
AIDS
conference:

In
the
past
two
months
the
effort
to
collect
the
payments
for
2010-2011
has
become
complicated
by
factors
surrounding
ICASA,
the
biennial
large
African
AIDS
conference
that
will
be
held
in
Ethiopia
the
first
week
of
December.
The
previous
two
ICASA
conference
in
Nigeria
and
Senegal
were
beset
by
logistical
and
financial
problems
and
Prime
Minister
Meles
and
Minister
of
Health
Tedros
have
worked
hard
to
make
the
Ethiopia
ICASA
the
most
successful
ever.
They
have
enlisted
Sheik
Mohammed
to
help
and
he
has
donated
the
venue
and
paid
for
an
additional
$8-10
million
of
expenses.


Minister
Tedros
invited
YOU
to
participate
in
ICASA,
and
apparently
he
or
someone
else
connected
with
ICASA
asked
the
Sheik
if
he
would
provide
a
plane
to
bring
YOU
to
Ethiopia
for
the
event.
The
Sheik
agreed
to
provide
a
plane,
and
instructed
Ambassador
Hicks
to
tell
CHAI
one
would
be
available.

Where
things
get
hot,
and
where
the
Clinton
Foundation
is
accused
of
"coercion"
by
the
Sheik's
Washington
attorney
George
Salem,
is
in
the
negotiation
over
whether
Clinton
should
come
to
Ethiopia
without
having
been
wired
the
funds
up
front,
or
if
he
should
assume
that
the
billionaire
is
"good
for
the
money"
and
just
fly
out
there
on
good
will.

When
George
Salem
spoke
with
the
Sheik
about
the
payment,
he
was
told
by
the
Sheik
to
make
sure
YOU
knew
that
the
Sheik
would
very
much
like
for
you
to
attend
ICASA
and
that
he
would
provide
transportation.
In
response,
Bruce
told
George
that
if
the
Sheik
would
wire
$6
million
to
the
Foundation
for
2010-2012
that
he
would
make
sure
YOU
attended
ICASA.
After
Bruce’s
stroke,
George
told
Ed
Wood
of
CHAI
that
the
Sheik
said
he
did
not
like
“
coercion
”
and
that
we
should
know
that
he
was
“
good
for
the
money
.”
George
reiterated
that
the
money
would
be
paid,
but
could
not
give
a
date.


The
Sheik
seems
to
feel
that
we
asked
him
for
transportation
and
then
decided
not
to
use
it.
George
and
Ambassador
Hicks
have
been
told
that
the
request
for
transportation
did
not
originate
with
us,
but
we
are
not
sure
that
the
message
reached
the
Sheik.

Ultimately
the
negotiations
for
Clinton
flying
to
Ethiopia
stalled,
and
appear
to
have
fallen
apart,
leading
to
the
original
quote
from
the
Clinton
Foundation's
Amitabh
Desai
in
which
he
said,
as
we
noted
earlier
this
month,
that
"
Unless
Sheikh
Mo
has
sent
us
a
$6
million
check,
this
sounds
crazy
to
do.
"
As
a
result,
the
memo
gives
WJC
the
following
action
point:

George
Salem,
Ambassador
Hicks,
and
CHAI
feel
that
it
would
be
helpful
if
you
would
call
the
Sheik
and
thank
him
for
offering
the
plane
and
saying
you
are
sorry
you
can’t
attend
ICASA.
We
don’t
think
it
is
necessary
for
YOU
to
bring
up
the
payment
issue
directly.

The
memo
concludes
with
the
following
talking
points:
YOU
should
thank
the
Sheik
for
his
support
of
all
our
efforts
in
Ethiopia,
and
especially
for
offering
to
provide
a
plane
to
bring
you
to
the
ICASA
meeting.
YOU
should
express
your
regrets
that
you
were
not
able
to
arrange
your
schedule
to
attend
the
ICASA
meeting
since
you
know
how
important
it
is
to
Ethiopia
and
to
the
Sheik.
You
should
express
your
appreciation
that
he
has
helped
make
this
event
possible
during
a
difficult
time
for
the
international
AIDS
effort.
YOU
should
say
you
hope
to
be
able
to
visit
with
the
Sheik
again
soon
either
in
Ethiopia
or
elsewhere.

This
memo
provides
valuable
insight
into
just
how
the
"charitable"
Clinton
Foundation
truly
operated:
absent
being
made
whole
on
millions
of
dollars
in
payments
-
by
a
donor
who
had
already
provided
it
with
$6
million
in
the
past
-
the
"so
very
concerned"
about
AIDS
and
African
welfare
Foundation,
would
not
even
bother
to
fly
Bill
Clinton
for
a
1-2
day
trip
-
on
someone
else's
dime
-
to
something
as
simple,
yet
noble,
as
a
healthcare
conference:
precisely
what
the
Foundation,
and
Bill
Clinton's
presence,
is
supposed
to
represent
and
support.

It
also
shows
that
when
the
Foundation
found
itself
in
arrears
to
a
prominent
donor,
it
first
and
only
concern
was
how
to
get
paid;
all
else
-
up
to
and
including
doing
the
absolute
minimum
such
as
appearing
for
a
good
cause,
was
secondary
and
-
as
the
memo
documents
-
ultimately
irrelevant
unless
Clinton
and
the
CF
were
both
generously
compensated
for
their
efforts.

And
that,
in
a
nutshell
is
what
the
"generous
and
charitable"
Clinton
foundation
was
all
about:
make
sure
to
get
the
money,
the
rest
simply
did
not
matter.
