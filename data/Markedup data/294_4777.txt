Ten
months
ago
,
Ammon
and
Ryan
Bundy
caused
a
stir
when
they
,
along
with
a
number
of
their
supporters
,
seized
control
of
a
federally
owned
wildlife
sanctuary
.
For
six
weeks
,
they
occupied
the
land
,
demanding
that
the
government
surrender
the
nearly
200
,
000
acre
preserve
to
the
locals
.

After
the
weeks
-
long
standoff
ended
peacefully
,
federal
weapons
and
conspiracy
charges
were
filed
against
both
Bundys
and
5
additional
members
of
their
group
.

Their
trial
,
which
lasted
nearly
as
long
as
their
attempted
insurrection
,
ended
Thursday
with
all
parties
(
Ryan
Bundy
,
Ammon
Bundy
,
Brian
Cavalier
,
Peter
Santilli
,
Shawna
Cox
,
Ryan
Payne
,
and
Joseph
O’Shaughnessy
)
being
acquitted
.

The
New
York
Times
reports:

"
The
defendants
never
denied
that
they
had
occupied
and
held
the
Malheur
National
Wildlife
Refuge
headquarters
for
nearly
six
weeks
,
demanding
that
the
federal
government
surrender
the
188
,
000
-
acre
property
to
local
control
.

But
their
lawyers
argued
that
prosecutors
did
not
prove
that
the
group
had
engaged
in
an
illegal
conspiracy
that
kept
federal
workers
—
employees
of
the
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
and
the
Bureau
of
Land
Management
—
from
doing
their
jobs
.
"

The
Washington
Times
provided
some
additional
information
about
the
individual
charges:

All
seven
faced
charges
of
conspiring
to
impede
federal
employees
,
while
four
were
also
charged
with
possession
of
firearms
at
a
federal
facility
and
two
had
an
additional
charge
of
theft
of
government
property
.

The
jury
had
not
yet
reported
on
one
undisclosed
charge
,
according
to
the
Associated
Press
.
"

The
trial
was
not
without
its
exciting
moments
—
Judge
Anna
J
.
Brown
of
the
U
.
S
.
District
Court
ordered
that
one
juror
be
dismissed
just
one
day
before
the
verdict
was
returned
.
Attorneys
for
the
defendants
called
for
either
the
juror's
removal
or
a
mistrial
after
he
was
accused
of
bias
.

One
of
the
defendants
,
Brian
“Booda”
Cavalier
,
was
sentenced
on
Tuesday
to
time
served
,
or
nine
months
,
for
“conspiring
to
impede
federal
workers
through
intimidation
,
threat
or
force
,
as
well
as
possession
of
a
firearm
at
a
federal
facility
.
”

Immediately
following
the
trial
,
Ammon
Bundy
was
placed
under
arrest
again
.

Bundy's
attorney
,
Marcus
Mumford
,
put
up
such
a
fuss
that
he
was
tackled
by
U
.
S
.
Marshals
in
the
courtroom:
Marcus
Mumford
was
just
tackled
to
the
ground
by
at
least
5
us
marshals
after
kept
arguing
that
Ammon
Bundy
was
free
to
go

But
Bundy's
arrest
stemmed
from
an
earlier
standoff
also
involving
a
land
dispute
with
the
federal
government
.
He
is
being
extradited
to
Nevada
,
where
he
will
stand
trial
for
his
role
in
that
confrontation
as
well
.
