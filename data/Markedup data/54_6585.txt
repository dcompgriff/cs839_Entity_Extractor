Historians
were
undertaking
a
frantic
reassessment
of
the
contribution
of
Mark
Twain
yesterday
,
after
the
surprise
discovery
of
a
box
of
jottings
by
the
famous
American
author
,
known
for
his
sparkling
epigrams
.
The
box
,
containing
notes
from
his
early
life
in
Missouri
was
uncovered
during
a
spring
clean
of
the
Twain
family
home
in
Connecticut
,
now
a
working
museum
dedicated
to
the
literary
legend
.
On
one
note
,
Twain
wrote
that
‘golf
is
a
good
wank
spoiled’
,
casting
considerable
doubt
on
the
commonly
held
view
that
he
was
comparing
the
sport
unfavourably
to
a
walk
in
the
park
.

‘Twain
was
a
prodigious
masturbator
as
a
teenager
,
that
much
we
know
from
published
memoirs
,
and
the
extensive
porn
collection
found
under
his
mattress
,
’
indicated
Cecile
De
Mornay
,
Professor
of
American
Literature
at
Oxford
University
.
‘These
new
notes
reveal
much
about
the
state
of
his
mind
–
and
his
trousers
–
during
his
formative
years
.
As
he
entered
adolescence
,
it
seems
he
struggled
to
find
much
privacy
in
the
family
home
,
so
he
would
often
sneak
off
to
the
local
golf
club
to
snap
one
out
.
’

‘The
local
toilets
at
the
club
provided
him
with
a
nice
quiet
space
for
him
to
bash
his
bishop
,
’
continued
De
Mornay
.
‘Frustratingly
for
him
,
sometimes
,
other
members
of
the
golf
club
would
spot
him
before
he
reached
the
toilets
,
and
,
understandably
,
they
would
invite
him
to
join
them
for
18
holes
,
thus
spoiling
his
regular
bouts
of
self
-
discovery
.
A
round
of
fourballs
,
rather
than
his
preference
for
a
solitary
game
with
two
balls
and
a
wood
,
if
you
like
.
’

Experts
suggest
that
this
discovery
will
not
be
a
long
term
stain
on
Twain’s
reputation
,
although
the
impact
on
his
bedsheets
is
a
different
matter
.
‘Twain’s
place
in
the
spotlight
will
come
again’
,
concluded
De
Mornay
confidently
.
‘Although
,
with
this
new
discovery
,
it
is
actually
his
come
that
is
being
placed
under
the
spotlight
.
