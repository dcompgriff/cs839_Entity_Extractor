Apparently
,
Donald
Trump
has
already
activated
the
‘reset
button’
with
Russia
And
this
is
why
Hillary
Clinton
never
could
.
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
expressed
his
bewilderment
at
why
European
countries
were
taking
in
so
many
migrants
given
the
increasing
number
of
rapes
sweeping
the
continent
,
asserting
that
a
society
which
cannot
protect
its
children
“has
no
future”
.
Putin
made
reference
to
a
story
out
of
Austria
where
an
Iraqi
migrant
was
not
punished
for
raping
a
10
-
year
-
old
boy
at
a
swimming
pool
in
Vienna
after
he
claimed
it
was
a
“sexual
emergency”
and
that
he
didn’t
understand
the
boy
didn’t
want
to
be
raped
.
“I
can’t
even
explain
the
rationale
–
is
it
a
sense
of
guilt
before
the
illegal
alien
Muslim
migrants
?
A
society
that
cannot
defend
its
children
today
has
no
tomorrow
,
it
has
no
future
,
”
warned
Putin
,
adding
that
he
would
not
look
to
Europe
for
advice
on
Russia’s
immigration
policy
given
the
situation
that
is
unfolding
there
.
