,
2016
When
Hitler’s
henchman
Adolf
Eichmann
arrived
in
Hungary
,
to
oversee
the
murder
of
that
country’s
Jews
,
George
Soros
ended
up
with
a
man
whose
job
was
confiscating
property
from
the
Jewish
population
.

George
Soros
and
other
rich
liberals
who
spent
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
trying
to
elect
Hillary
Clinton
are
gathering
in
Washington
for
a
three
-
day
,
closed
door
meeting
to
retool
the
big
-
money
left
to
fight
back
against
Donald
Trump
.
Since
Soros
name
is
very
much
in
the
headlines
in
2016
,
let’s
take
a
look
at
an
interview
he
gave
in
1998
about
his
Nazi
past
.
Nazi
collaborator
Soros
gave
MILLIONS
to
Hillary
Clinton’s
failed
campaign

Social
unrest
groups
like
<[>Media
Matters<]>
have
taken
to
the
Internet
in
an
attempt
to
“
debunk
the
claims
”
and
“
correct
the
smears
”
about
rumors
of
the
Nazi
past
of
their
patron
,
George
Soros
.
They
say
it
is
just
malicious
gossip
and
lies
people
make
up
about
Soros
because
they
don’t
like
him
.
<[>Snopes
.
com<]>
chimes
in
as
well
in
defense
of
Soros
.
But
what
about
the
“
rumors
”
?
Could
they
be
true
,
are
they
true
?

As
you
will
see
and
hear
,
not
only
are
the
rumors
true
,
a
long
forgotten
interview
George
Soros
did
on
60
Minutes
has
him
gleefully
confessing
to
his
crime
.

György
Schwartz
,
better
known
to
the
world
as
George
Soros
,
was
born
August
12
,
1930
in
Hungary
.
Soros’
father
,
Tivadar
,
was
a
fervent
practitioner
of
the
Esperanto
language
invented
in
1887
,
and
designed
to
be
the
first
global
language
,
free
of
any
national
identity
.
The
Schwartz’s
,
who
were
non
-
practicing
Jews
,
changed
the
family
name
to
Soros
,
in
order
to
facilitate
assimilation
into
the
Gentile
population
,
as
the
Nazis
spread
into
Hungary
during
the
1930s

When
Hitler’s
henchman
Adolf
Eichmann
arrived
in
Hungary
,
to
oversee
the
murder
of
that
country’s
Jews
,
George
Soros
ended
up
with
a
man
whose
job
was
confiscating
property
from
the
Jewish
population
.
Soros
went
with
him
on
his
rounds
.

During
an
interview
with
“
Sixty
Minute’s
”
Steve
Kroft
,
Soros
was
asked
about
his
“
best
year

”

with
the
Nazis

in

“
best
time
of
my
life

,
in
context
,
that
startling
confession
.

KROFT
:
My
understanding
is
that
you
went
out
with
this
protector
of
yours
who
swore
that
you
were
his
adopted
godson
.

SOROS
:
Yes
.
Yes
.

KROFT
:
Went
out
,
in
fact
,
and
helped
in
the
confiscation
of
property
from
your
fellow
Jews
,
friends
and
neighbors
.

SOROS
:
Yes
.
That’s
right
.
Yes
.

KROFT
:
I
mean
,
that
sounds
like
an
experience
that
would
send
lots
of
people
to
the
psychiatric
couch
for
many
,
many
,
years
.
Was
it
difficult
?

SOROS
:
No
,
not
at
all
.
Not
at
all
,
I
rather
enjoyed
it
.

KROFT
:
No
feelings
of
guilt
?

SOROS
:
No
,
only
feelings
of
absolute
power
.
