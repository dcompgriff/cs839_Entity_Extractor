Tollfree
Woman
faces
jail
for
dismal
selection
of
office
birthday
cakes

An
Essex
woman
is
facing
prison
for
providing
a
dismal
selection
of
cakes
for
the
office
to
celebrate
her
birthday
.

The
incident
took
place
at
the
offices
of
<[>Hadley
and
Kemp
Solutions<]>
in
Hatfield
Peveral
yesterday
.
It
was
Eileen
Plankton’s
birthday
and
anticipation
was
high
as
she
entered
the
office
with
several
<[>Marks
and
Spencer<]>
bags
.

“Oh
yeah
,
everyone
was
really
impressed
,
”
said
a
colleague
who
wished
to
remain
anonymous
.

“I
mean
–
Markses
;
I
thought
we
were
in
for
a
real
treat
.
They
do
a
lovely
cream
horn
.
”

After
several
hours
of
playfully
tormenting
her
colleagues
with
amusing
comments
like
‘these
bags
?
No
,
they’re
just
lunch
.
I’m
a
bit
peckish
today
,
’
Mrs
Plankton
finally
sent
the
following
email:

21
again
,
and
if
you
believe
that
you’ll
believe
anything
.
Some
sweet
treats
on
Len’s
desk
(
he’s
off
having
his
prolapse
sorted
,
so
he
won’t
mind
)
.

However
,
excitement
turned
to
disappointment
as
the
true
nature
of
the
cakes
became
clear
.

“Well
,
she
might
as
well
have
just
shat
all
over
the
desk
,
”
continued
Mrs
Plankton’s
colleague
.

“They
weren’t
Markses
cakes
at
all
,
she’d
just
reused
the
bags
.
There
was
a
box
of
<[>Poundstretcher's<]>
broken
biscuits
,
some
cheap
cheese
straws
and
six
boxes
of
Value
jam
tarts
.

“I
mean
,
I
didn’t
know
what
to
do
with
myself
.
This
horrible
silence
descended
as
everyone
saw
what
she’d
done
.

“I
just
ate
nine
jam
tarts
without
looking
at
her
and
walked
off
not
even
bothering
to
say
‘Thank
you’
.
”

Shortly
afterwards
the
police
were
called
,
Mrs
Plankton
was
arrested
and
she
is
expected
to
be
sentenced
to
between
18
-
24
months
for
her
crimes
.
