All
this
non
-
GAAP
activity
should
be
disclosed
in
the
footnotes
.

Where
is
the
confusion
coming
from
?

Peeps
who
can't
read
a
10Q
?
Also
Tesla's
auditors
should
have
required
a
period
-
to
-
period
crosswalk
of
the
numbers
both
pre
-
adjusted
and
post
-
adjsuted
just
so
they
can
compare
apples
to
apples
.

Did
this
not
happen
?
Anyway
,
just
rely
on
the
opinion
,
and
sue
if
it
all
goes
south
.

That's
why
auditors
get
paid
to
perform
the
same
test
work
period
after
period
after
period
.
