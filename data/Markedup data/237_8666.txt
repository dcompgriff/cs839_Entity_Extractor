Editor’s
Comment:
Though
his
administration
is
still
taking
shape,
President-elect
Trump
may
be
able
to
claim
his
first
tangible
victory.
Though
Ford
Motors
were
resistant
to
Trump’s
trade
policy
positions
and
threatened
to
move
jobs
to
Mexico,
the
CEO
has
now
announced
that,
instead,
production
will
remain
American.

Is
Trump
pulling
televangelist-style
miracles
–
with
arrangements
ahead
of
time
in
the
back
room
–
or
is
he
making
things
happen
because
he
is
in
a
position
to
make
good
on
his
policy
promises?
Either
way,
Ford
and
other
big
companies
will
be
keeping
optics
in
mind
when
they
decide
whether
or
not
to
play
ball
with
the
wild
card
Trump
administration
(at
this
point,
still
to
be).
If
this
actually
becomes
the
trend,
perhaps
there
is
a
lot
of
positive
that
can
be
done
for
the
economy,
and
perhaps
good
paying
jobs
can
return
for
struggling
working
class
Americans.
Only
time
will
tell,
but
he
hasn’t
even
assumed
office
yet.

Ford
CEO
Folds?
Trump
Confirms
Carmaker
Won’t
Move
Production
To
Mexico

by
Tyler
Durden
Just
hours
after
Ford
CEO
complained
of
the
“huge
impact”
of
Donald
Trump’s
proposed
trade
plans,
following
the
company’s
plan
to
move
a
substantial
portion
of
its
passenger-car
production
to
Mexico
from
a
factory
in
Michigan,
Donald
Trump
tweeted
“Just
got
a
call
from
my
friend
Bill
Ford,
Chairman
of
Ford,
who
advised
me
that
he
will
be
keeping
the
Lincoln
plant
in
Kentucky
—
no
Mexico,”
seemingly
winning
his
first
‘america-first’
victory.
As
WSJ
reported
yesterday,
Ford
Motor
Co.
Chief
Executive
Mark
Fields
issued
a
warning
about
President-elect
Donald
Trump’s
proposed
trade
policies,
saying
high
tariffs
on
automobiles
and
other
products
coming
into
the
U.S.
would
be
a
blow
to
the
auto
industry
and
broader
U.S.
economy.
Mr.
Fields,
speaking
with
reporters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
Los
Angeles
Auto
Show
on
Tuesday,
said
Ford
has
talked
to
Mr.
Trump’s
transition
team
and
believes
the
company
can
work
with
the
new
administration.
During
a
separate
interview,
he
said,
“We
all
share
the
same
objective;
we
want
a
vibrant
and
healthy
U.S.
economy.”

The
two
sides,
however,
appear
to
be
at
odds
on
how
to
achieve
that
goal.
Ford’s
plan
to
move
a
substantial
portion
of
its
passenger-car
production
to
Mexico
from
a
factory
in
Michigan
was
heavily
criticized
by
Mr.
Trump
on
the
campaign
trail.
Like
many
of
its
rivals,
Ford
is
building
more-profitable
light
trucks
in
the
U.S.
while
investing
in
new
capacity
in
Mexico
to
produce
lower-margin
small
cars.
And
then
hours
later,
Donald
Trump
tweeted…
Just
got
a
call
from
my
friend
Bill
Ford,
Chairman
of
Ford,
who

I
worked
hard
with
Bill
Ford
to
keep
the
Lincoln
plant
in
Kentucky.
I
owed
it
to
the
great
State
of
Kentucky
for
their
confidence
in
me!

was
followed
by

confirming
