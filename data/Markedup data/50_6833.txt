A
suburban
Detroit
homeowner
and
Trump
supporter
just
took
the
Republican
Party
platform
and
proudly
displayed
it
on
his
front
lawn
,
creating
a
despicably
terrifying
display
of
Democratic
nominee
Hillary
Clinton
sitting
in
a
mock
electric
chair
,
screaming
in
agony
as
she
is
executed
.

The
photo
of
the
offensive
display
was
taken
by
a
reader
in
Waterford
Township
,
a
suburb
northwest
of
Detroit
which
is
89
%
populated
by
white
residents
.
It’s
unknown
if
authorities
have
been
alerted
,
but
this
display
is
the
end
result
of
months
of
extremist
electioneering
by
the
Trump
and
Republican
Party
,
who
have
been
hell
-
bent
on
dehumanizing



American
politics
never
had
a
tradition
of
demanding
the
jailing
of
one’s
political
opponent
,
nor
to
encouragement
of
supporters
to
engage
in
political
violence
,
but
that’s
today’s
Republican
Party
under
Donald
Trump
.
His
campaign
has
broken
America’s
political
taboos
with
open
calls
for
violence
,
even
winding
up
under
Secret
Service
investigation
twice
.
Trump
himself
drew
an
unprecedented
public
scolding
from
the
Secret
Service
for
saying
that
“
second
amendment
people
”
should
take
matters
into
their
own
hands
if/when
he
Hillary
beats
him
.

Trump’s
sycophantic
surrogates
Chris
Christie
and
Rudy
Giuliani
completely
debased
the
high
titles
of
their
former
prosecutorial
offices
within
the
federal
government
by
calling
for
Hillary
Clinton
to
be
“locked
up
.
”
Sadly
,
that
has
become
the
only
policy
proposal
of
the
Republican
Party
—
beyond
Trump’s
plans
to
kiss
up
to
Russia’s
dictator
Vladimir
Putin
and
Mike
Pence’s
plan
to
manage
women’s
health
with
scripture
.

Now
,
Trump’s
followers
have
internalized
the
calls
for
political
violence
,
and
here
is
is
the
result
in
suburban
Michigan:

It
doesn’t
get
any
more
deplorable
than
this
,
folks
.
