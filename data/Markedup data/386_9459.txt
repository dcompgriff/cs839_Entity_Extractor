The
intense
anti
-
Russian
campaign
in
the
West
is
a
sign
of
weakness
rather
than
strength
.
The
Russian
air
defence
system
in
Syria
has
closed
down
the
US's
military
options
.
Hillary
Clinton
knows
it
and
her
policies
in
Syria
if
she
is
elected
President
will
be
simply
a
continuation
of
Obama's
.
Share
on
Facebook
October
2016
will
one
day
be
recognised
as
one
of
those
months
–
like
October
1962
and
October
1973
–
when
the
world
passed
through
a
period
of
great
danger
.
The
cause
of
the
danger
was
the
collapse
in
September
of
the
Kerry
-
Lavrov
agreement
and
the
resulting
stand
-
off
this
October
between
the
US
and
Russia
in
Syria
.
This
culminated
in
high
level
discussions
within
the
US
government
about
possible
attacks
on
Syrian
army
bases
,
followed
by
public
threats
from
Russia
to
shoot
down
US
aircraft
if
such
attacks
took
place
.
As
The
Duran
reported
–
but
as
the
Western
media
has
conspicuously
failed
to
do
–
following
these
threats
from
Russia
,
the
US
backed
down
.
These
events
have
been
barely
reported
in
the
West
.
Instead
what
we
have
witnessed
is
a
deafening
cacophony
of
abuse
of
Russia
for
its
actions
in
Syria
,
with
the
country
baselessly
accused
of
war
crimes
,
and
with
things
written
and
said
about
its
political
leadership
which
go
far
beyond
what
was
written
and
said
even
during
the
height
of
the
Ukrainian
crisis
in
2014
.
At
one
level
this
abuse
is
an
attempt
to
embarrass
the
Russians
to
call
off
the
Syrian
army’s
offensive
on
the
Jihadi
held
districts
of
eastern
Aleppo
.
However
it
undoubtedly
also
reflects
the
huge
anger
and
sense
of
humiliation
in
Washington
and
in
certain
other
Western
capitals
caused
by
the
US
climbdown
earlier
in
the
month
.
The
intensity
of
the
media
campaign
against
Russia
is
however
creating
something
of
a
climate
of
fear
,
with
most
people
unaware
that
the
most
dangerous
moment
of
the
crisis
has
in
fact
already
passed
.
Much
of
this
fear
is
centred
on
the
personality
of
Hillary
Clinton
,
now
widely
expected
to
be
the
next
US
President
.
Based
on
her
record
and
her
statements
,
she
is
widely
supposed
to
be
a
hardline
foreign
policy
hawk
who
has
never
seen
a
war
she
didn’t
like
or
want
to
join
,
and
who
is
widely
expected
to
escalate
dramatically
the
confrontation
with
Russia
in
Syria
and
elsewhere
.
Many
also
point
to
Hillary
Clinton’s
known
previous
support
for
a
no
fly
zone
in
Syria
,
and
her
comments
on
the
campaign
trail
,
which
many
see
as
suggesting
that
she
plans
one
still
.
Is
all
this
however
true
?
Is
the
greatest
moment
of
confrontation
between
the
US
and
Russia
in
Syria
still
to
come
?
Will
things
really
get
far
more
dangerous
if
Hillary
Clinton
becomes
President
?
Are
we
really
looking
at
World
War
III
?
In
my
opinion
these
fears
are
wrong
.
The
great
confrontation
has
already
taken
place
,
and
it
took
place
this
October
.
A
direct
clash
between
the
US
and
the
Russian
militaries
in
Syria
was
avoided
,
and
there
is
now
no
possibility
that
it
will
happen
.
What
this
means
is
that
there
is
now
no
possibility
of
Hillary
Clinton
imposing
a
no
fly
zone
on
Syria
or
of
her
ordering
an
armed
confrontation
with
the
Russians
there
.
Nor
is
there
any
chance
of
Barack
Obama
doing
so
in
the
few
months
left
to
him
.
Nor
is
there
any
chance
of
either
Obama
or
Hillary
supporting
Boris
Johnson’s
hare
-
brained
idea
for
a
no
bombing
zone
in
Syria
,
or
of
either
of
Obama
or
Hillary
Clinton
ordering
US
attacks
on
Syrian
military
bases
.
The
reason
none
of
these
things
will
happen
is
because
the
US’s
uniformed
military
opposes
all
of
them
.
In
the
face
of
the
US
military’s
opposition
none
of
them
can
happen
.
The
reason
the
US
military
opposes
these
schemes
is
because
they
would
all
require
the
US
military
to
take
on
the
very
extensive
and
very
sophisticated
air
defence
system
the
Russians
have
set
up
in
Syria
.
The
US
military
has
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
it
is
completely
opposed
to
doing
this
.
In
the
days
immediately
following
the
US
climbdown
brave
reports
appeared
in
parts
of
the
media
which
claimed
the
US
military
is
confident
of
its
ability
to
take
on
and
defeat
the
Russian
air
defence
system
.
It
did
not
however
take
long
for
a
report
to
appear
in
The
Washington
Post
–
obviously
sourced
from
the
US
military
–
which
made
it
clear
that
this
is
not
the
case
.
The
Washington
Post
article
,
in
addition
to
giving
a
comprehensive
picture
of
the
scale
of
the
Russian
air
defence
system
in
Syria
,
contains
a
frank
admission
that
the
US
military
is
far
from
confident
of
its
ability
to
defeat
it
“While
there
is
some
disagreement
among
military
experts
as
to
the
capability
of
the
Russian
systems
,
particularly
the
newly
deployed
S
-
300
,
“the
reality
is
,
we’re
very
concerned
anytime
those
are
emplaced
,
”
a
U
.
S
.
Defense
official
said
.
Neither
its
touted
ability
to
counter
U
.
S
.
stealth
technology
,
or
to
target
low
-
flying
aircraft
,
has
ever
been
tested
by
the
United
States
.
“It’s
not
like
we’ve
had
any
shoot
at
an
F
-
35
,
”
the
official
said
of
the
next
-
generation
U
.
S
.
fighter
jet
.
“We’re
not
sure
if
any
of
our
aircraft
can
defeat
the
S
-
300
.
””
Since
this
article
appeared
in
The
Washington
Post
information
has
trickled
out
showing
just
how
formidable
the
Russian
defence
system
in
Syria
actually
is
.
Whatever
the
precise
purpose
of
the
Russian
military’s
complaint
about
the
alleged
Belgian
air
raid
on
Hasajek
,
it
does
at
least
show
that
the
Russians
can
now
track
US
and
NATO
aircraft
as
they
take
off
from
their
bases
in
Jordan
,
and
almost
certainly
from
Incirlik
air
base
in
Turkey
as
well
.
The
Israeli
newspaper
Haaretz
has
also
admitted
that
the
Russian
air
defence
system
is
restricting
the
operations
of
the
Israeli
force
,
with
the
US
based
internet
journal
Al
-
Monitor
reporting
–
based
obviously
on
information
provided
by
Israeli
sources
–
that
“The
S
-
300
and
S
-
400
missile
systems
that
Russia
put
in
place
cover
all
of
Israel
up
to
the
southern
Negev
.
Russian
radar
will
immediately
lock
on
Israeli
jets
taking
off
from
any
base
,
except
for
the
Uvda
air
force
base
near
the
southern
city
of
Eilat
,
and
their
flight
patterns
will
be
under
constant
surveillance
.
That
is
how
the
Russians
keep
an
eye
on
the
Israeli
air
force’s
activities
over
“hotspots”
along
the
borders
between
Syria
and
Lebanon
.
Should
he
want
to
,
Putin
can
simply
push
a
button
and
turn
the
lives
of
Israeli
pilots
and
the
commanders
who
sent
them
on
offensive
strikes
in
Syria
into
a
living
hell
.

Meanwhile
we
know
US
intelligence
is
advising
the
US
government
that
the
Russians
not
only
have
the
capability
to
shoot
down
US
aircraft
,
but
are
not
bluffing
when
they
say
they
will
do
so
.
No
less
a
person
than
Director
of
National
Intelligence
James
Clapper
,
speaking
to
the
Council
of
Foreign
Relations
on
Tuesday
25th
October
2016
,
has
said
as
much
“I
wouldn’t
put
it
past
them
(
NB:
the
Russians
–
AM
)
to
shoot
down
an
American
aircraft
if
they
felt
that
was
threatening
to
their
forces
on
the
ground
.
The
system
they
have
there
is
very
advanced
,
very
capable
and
I
don’t
think
they’d
do
it
–
deploy
it
–
if
they
didn’t
have
some
intention
to
use
it
.
”
The
Washington
Post
article
confirms
that
the
US
military
was
always
reluctant
to
impose
a
no
fly
zone
over
Syria
because
of
Syria’s
sophisticated
air
defences
.
In
the
face
of
the
vastly
more
sophisticated
air
defence
system
the
Russians
have
created
in
Syria
the
option
of
declaring
a
no
fly
zone
over
Syria
or
of
undertaking
any
of
the
other
US
military
options
that
have
been
talked
about
in
Syria
for
all
practical
purposes
no
longer
exists
.
In
saying
this
I
realise
some
people
continue
to
imagine
terrifying
scenarios
of
the
US
swamping
the
Russian
air
defence
system
in
Syria
by
launching
hundreds
of
aircraft
and
missiles
against
it
whilst
daring
Russia
to
escalate
.
In
the
real
world
of
political
and
military
decision
making
,
it
beggars
belief
the
US
military
would
be
prepared
to
do
this
in
view
of
the
heavy
casualties
and
the
possibility
of
uncontrolled
escalation
it
would
risk
.
There
is
simply
no
chance
of
the
US
military
willingly
engaging
in
a
military
confrontation
with
the
Russians
in
Syria
and
risking
World
War
III
in
order
to
rescue
a
gang
of
Al
-
Qaeda
led
Jihadi
terrorists
in
Aleppo
and
to
fulfil
some
people’s
fantasies
of
regime
change
there
.
None
of
this
is
going
to
change
if
Hillary
Clinton
is
elected
President
in
November
.
Whilst
Hillary
Clinton
could
in
theory
try
to
order
the
US
military
to
take
military
action
and
risk
confrontation
with
the
Russians
in
Syria
against
its
wishes
,
in
practical
political
terms
doing
this
is
all
but
impossible
since
it
would
leave
her
catastrophically
exposed
in
the
very
likely
event
that
something
went
badly
wrong
.
In
addition
Hillary
Clinton
would
almost
certainly
face
a
massive
groundswell
of
opposition
from
Congress
and
the
nation
,
which
would
surely
dwarf
the
one
that
caused
Obama
to
back
off
his
proposed
missile
strikes
against
Syria
in
2013
,
if
she
tried
to
do
such
a
completely
reckless
thing
.
Hillary
Clinton
,
whatever
her
faults
,
is
far
too
experienced
a
politician
to
take
on
these
well
-
nigh
unbelievable
risks
.
It
is
not
as
if
Hillary
Clinton
does
not
know
the
huge
risks
of
ordering
military
action
in
Syria
.
Here
is
what
she
said
about
them
back
in
2013
,
when
she
discussed
the
prospects
of
imposing
a
no
fly
zone
in
Syria
during
a
private
speech
to
Goldman
Sachs
“They
(
NB:
the
Syrians
–
AM
)
are
getting
more
sophisticated
thanks
to
Russian
imports
.
To
have
a
no
-
fly
zone
you
have
to
take
out
all
of
the
air
defense
,
many
of
which
are
located
in
populated
areas
.
So
our
missiles
,
even
if
they
are
standoff
missiles
so
we’re
not
putting
our
pilots
at
risk—you’re
going
to
kill
a
lot
of
Syrians
.
So
all
of
a
sudden
this
intervention
that
people
talk
about
so
glibly
becomes
an
American
and
NATO
involvement
where
you
take
a
lot
of
civilians
.
In
Libya
we
didn’t
have
that
problem
.
It’s
a
huge
place
.
The
air
defenses
were
not
that
sophisticated
and
there
wasn’t
very—in
fact
,
there
were
very
few
civilian
casualties
.
That
wouldn’t
be
the
case
.
And
then
you
add
on
to
it
a
lot
of
the
air
defenses
are
not
only
in
civilian
population
centers
but
near
some
of
their
chemical
stockpiles
.
You
do
not
want
a
missile
hitting
a
chemical
stockpile
.
”
Note
that
Hillary
Clinton
said
all
these
things
back
in
2013
,
long
before
the
Russians
deployed
their
own
vastly
more
sophisticated
air
defence
system
in
Syria
.
If
she
had
doubts
about
the
wisdom
of
military
action
in
Syria
in
2013
,
then
she
will
have
far
greater
doubts
about
it
now
If
a
President
as
belligerent
and
confrontational
as
George
W
.
Bush
was
unable
to
order
the
US
military
to
attack
Iran
against
its
wishes
–
as
he
undoubtedly
wanted
–
then
there
is
no
possibility
Hillary
Clinton
–
who
despite
her
reputation
is
neither
stupid
nor
a
fanatic
–
can
order
the
US
military
against
its
wishes
to
attack
the
Russian
military
in
Syria
now
.
What
then
of
Hillary
Clinton’s
supposed
campaign
statements
about
wanting
a
no
fly
zone
in
Syria
?
When
these
are
read
carefully
it
becomes
clear
that
Hillary
Clinton
plans
no
such
thing
.
Here
is
what
she
had
to
say
on
the
subject
during
her
third
debate
with
Donald
Trump
“First
of
all
,
I
think
a
no
-
fly
zone
could
save
lives
and
could
hasten
the
end
of
the
conflict
.
I’m
well
aware
of
the
really
legitimate
concerns
you
have
expressed
from
both
the
president
and
the
general
.
This
would
not
be
done
just
on
the
first
day
.
This
would
take
a
lot
of
negotiation
,
and
it
would
also
take
making
it
clear
to
the
Russians
and
the
Syrians
that
our
purpose
here
was
to
provide
safe
Zones
on
the
ground
.
”
(
bold
italics
added
)
In
other
words
what
Hillary
Clinton
is
really
supporting
is
not
a
no
fly
zone
across
the
whole
of
Syria
,
but
a
“safe
zone”
within
Syria
the
terms
of
which
would
be
negotiated
with
the
Syrians
and
the
Russians
.
That
is
of
course
exactly
what
the
Turks
–
with
US
support
–
are
already
busy
setting
up
in
north
east
Syria
through
their
Operation
Euphrates
Shield
.
In
fact
the
more
carefully
Hillary
Clinton’s
comments
are
analysed
the
clearer
it
becomes
that
her
policies
if
elected
would
be
essentially
the
same
as
those
of
the
current
Obama
administration
.
In
her
private
2013
comments
to
Goldman
Sachs
she
made
it
clear
that
her
preferred
way
of
working
in
Syria
was
not
through
direct
confrontation
with
the
Syrians
but
covertly
–
in
other
words
by
arming
and
aiding
the
famously
elusive
“moderate
rebels”
in
Syria
in
exactly
the
way
the
US
under
Obama
has
been
doing
“And
there
is
still
an
argument
that
goes
on
inside
the
administration
and
inside
our
friends
at
NATO
and
the
Europeans
.
How
do
intervene—my
view
was
you
intervene
as
covertly
as
is
possible
for
Americans
to
intervene
.
We
used
to
be
much
better
at
this
than
we
are
now
.
”
(
bold

)
However
in
her
final
third
debate
with
Donald
Trump
she
let
slip
that
she
is
no
more
keen
for
Jihadis
to
get
hold
of
sophisticated
weapons
(
including
by
implication
anti
aircraft
weapons
)
than
Obama
is
,
even
if
she
tried
to
hide
the
fact
by
making
a
bizarre
point
about
terrorists
being
prevented
from
buying
guns
across
the
counter
in
the
US
“That’s
why
I
want
to
have
an
intelligence
surge
that
protect
us
here
at
home
while
we
have
to
go
after
them
from
the
air
,
on
the
ground
,
online
.
Why
we
have
to
make
sure
here
at
home
we
don’t
let
terrorists
buy
weapons
.
If
you’re
too
dangerous
to
fly
,
you’re
too
dangerous
to
buy
a
gun
.
”
This
is
consistent
with
what
Hillary
Clinton
said
in
2013
to
the
Jewish
United
Fund
Advance
&
Major
Gifts
Dinner
,
where
she
admitted
that
the
large
scale
presence
of
militant
Jihadi
groups
sponsored
by
Saudi
Arabia
and
Qatar
in
Syria
has
made
distinguishing
between
“moderate
rebels”
and
Jihadi
militants
–
and
preventing
weapons
supplied
to
“moderate
rebels”
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
Jihadi
militants
–
all
but
impossible
“Some
of
us
thought
,
perhaps
,
we
could
,
with
a
more
robust
,
covert
action
trying
to
vet
,
identify
,
train
and
arm
cadres
of
rebels
that
would
at
least
have
the
firepower
to
be
able
to
protect
themselves
against
both
Assad
and
the
Al
-
Qaeda
-
related
jihadist
groups
that
have
,
unfortunately
,
been
attracted
to
Syria
.
That’s
been
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
Saudis
and
others
are
shipping
large
amounts
of
weapons—and
pretty
indiscriminately—not
at
all
targeted
toward
the
people
that
we
think
would
be
the
more
moderate
,
least
likely
,
to
cause
problems
in
the
future
,
but
this
is
another
one
of
those
very
tough
analytical
problems
.
”
Overall
it
is
impossible
to
see
any
real
difference
between
the
policies
Hillary
Clinton
advocates
and
those
Barack
Obama
is
already
following
in
Syria
.
Like
Barack
Obama
Hillary
Clinton
does
not
intend
to
impose
a
no
fly
zone
.
Like
Barack
Obama
Hillary
Clinton
is
wary
of
supplying
sophisticated
weapons
to
the
“moderate
rebels”
in
case
they
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
Jihadi
militants
.
Hillary
Clinton
does
want
to
set
up
a
“safe
zone”
in
Syria
,
which
she
believes
(
almost
certainly
wrongly
)
will
give
her
“leverage”
over
the
Russians
in
future
negotiations
about
Syria’s
future
.
However
she
realises
this
has
to
be
negotiated
with
the
Russians
,
and
besides
it
is
what
Erdogan
and
Obama
are
already
busy
trying
to
set
up
in
north
east
Syria
through
Operation
Euphrates
Shield
,
so
far
with
only
very
partial
success
.
Even
Hillary
Clinton’s
immediately
declared
objectives
are
the
same
as
Obama’s
.
Like
Obama
her
priority
is
not
regime
change
in
Damascus
or
the
capture
of
Aleppo
;
it
is
the
capture
first
of
Mosul
and
then
of
Raqqah
“The
goal
here
is
to
take
back
Mosul
.
It’s
going
to
be
a
hard
fight
.
I’ve
got
no
illusions
about
that
.
And
then
continue
to
press
into
Syria
to
begin
to
take
back
and
move
on
Raqqah
,
which
is
the
ISIS
headquarters
.
”
It
is
no
coincidence
that
shortly
after
these
comments
the
Obama
administration
openly
discussed
plans
to
capture
Raqqah
.
The
similarity
of
positions
on
Syria
between
Obama
and
Hillary
Clinton
in
fact
reveals
an
important
truth
about
a
future
Hillary
Clinton
administration:
it
would
not
be
a
new
administration
at
all
,
but
rather
it
would
be
an
extension
of
the
present
one
.
This
is
not
surprising
.
Hillary
Clinton
and
Barack
Obama
worked
closely
together
when
Hillary
Clinton
was
Obama’s
Secretary
of
State
.
Obama
obviously
wants
her
to
win
the
election
and
is
pulling
out
all
the
stops
to
help
her
.
it
is
a
certainty
she
is
being
consulted
about
administration
policy
and
has
a
role
in
making
it
,
and
that
issues
like
the
capture
of
Mosul
and
Raqqah
are
discussed
with
her
.
Just
as
Obama
is
less
of
a
dove
than
he
sometimes
likes
to
pretend
,
so
Hillary
Clinton
is
less
of
a
hawk
than
she
sometimes
wants
people
to
think
.
It
is
often
overlooked
that
Obama
and
Hillary
Clinton
are
both
lawyers
.
Both
are
skilled
at
using
language
to
give
a
sometimes
misleading
impression
of
what
they
are
about
.
There
is
no
doubt
about
the
huge
anger
and
of
the
sense
of
humiliation
in
Washington
at
the
climbdown
Russia
forced
on
the
US
this
October
.
There
is
also
no
doubt
that
there
are
lots
of
people
in
the
US
foreign
policy
establishment
who
yearn
for
a
President
who
will
“put
Putin
in
his
place”
and
who
will
take
a
more
confrontational
line
with
Russia
on
Syria
and
elsewhere
.
These
people
unfortunately
have
achieved
a
lock
-
grip
on
the
US
and
Western
media
,
and
this
enables
them
to
a
great
degree
to
shape
the
public
discussion
with
the
result
that
they
have
a
disproportionate
influence
on
policy
.
Unfortunately
Hillary
Clinton
has
chosen
to
fight
her
election
campaign
by
pandering
to
these
people
.
The
result
is
that
she
gives
the
impression
of
intending
a
more
confrontational
policy
in
Syria
than
a
careful
analysis
of
her
words
shows
she
really
does
.
Thus
she
has
fostered
the
impression
that
she
is
looking
to
impose
a
no
fly
zone
on
Syria
when
a
careful
analysis
of
her
words
shows
she
intends
no
such
thing
.
This
is
going
to
create
many
problems
for
Hillary
Clinton
if
she
does
win
the
election
.
However
that
does
not
change
the
fact
,
which
Hillary
Clinton
certainly
knows
,
that
following
the
events
of
this
October
a
direct
military
confrontation
between
the
US
and
the
Russians
in
Syria
because
of
the
opposition
of
the
US
military
quite
simply
cannot
happen
.
The
US
is
not
going
to
declare
a
no
fly
zone
over
Syria
,
or
ride
to
the
rescue
of
the
Jihadis
in
Aleppo
,
or
take
any
other
military
steps
there
beyond
those
it
has
already
taken
,
whether
Hillary
Clinton
is
elected
US
President
in
November
or
not
.
What
we
are
unfortunately
likely
to
see
is
a
case
of
more
of
the
same
,
even
though
that
is
a
same
which
has
already
repeatedly
failed
.
Thus
we
can
expect
more
attempts
to
identify
and
train
“moderate”
Jihadis
and
to
supply
them
with
more
weapons
–
this
time
inside
the
Turkish
controlled
“safe
zone”
that
is
being
created
for
them
–
and
perhaps
more
efforts
to
redirect
the
more
radical
Jihadis
from
Iraq
to
Syria
to
cause
more
trouble
for
the
Russians
and
for
the
Syrian
government
.
In
my
opinion
these
policies
–
which
are
simply
continuations
of
the
policies
the
US
has
been
following
in
Syria
ever
since
the
war
started
there
more
than
four
years
ago
–
are
unsustainable
,
and
are
bound
eventually
to
fail
.
With
the
populous
areas
of
western
Syria
and
the
main
cities
all
likely
to
fall
soon
under
the
secure
control
of
the
internationally
recognised
Syrian
government
,
these
policies
cannot
achieve
regime
change
in
Syria
.
If
the
US
persists
with
them
the
US
far
more
than
Russia
risks
becomes
bogged
down
in
Syria
in
a
war
it
cannot
win
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
tell
-
tale
signs
this
is
already
happening
,
with
the
US
plan
to
advance
on
Raqqah
already
causing
problems
with
the
US’s
Turkish
ally
.
Putting
all
that
aside
,
the
sound
and
fury
of
the
current
anti
-
Russian
campaign
should
not
mislead
us
.
It
is
not
a
reason
for
fear
.
It
is
a
product
of
weakness
and
failure
,
not
of
confidence
and
strength
.
Its
exceptionally
high
volume
and
its
ferocious
tone
are
the
product
of
the
US’s
feelings
of
humiliation
and
failure
in
Syria
following
the
events
of
this
October
.
It
is
after
all
natural
for
someone
who
feels
defeated
to
over
-
compensate
by
being
over
-
assertive
,
and
that
is
what
we
are
witnessing
now
.
Certainly
the
anti
-
Russian
campaign
is
not
a
sign
the
US
is
about
to
go
to
war
with
Russia
,
whether
in
Syria
or
anywhere
else
.
On
the
contrary
it
is
a
reflection
of
the
fact
war
cannot
happen
precisely
because
the
US
in
the
form
of
the
Russian
air
defence
system
in
Syria
is
now
faced
with
an
adversary
it
is
not
confident
it
can
defeat
at
any
remotely
acceptable
cost
.
Irrespective
of
whether
Hillary
Clinton
wins
the
Presidency
in
November
,
that
is
the
reality
.
The
moment
of
greatest
danger
in
the
Syrian
crisis
has
passed
.
