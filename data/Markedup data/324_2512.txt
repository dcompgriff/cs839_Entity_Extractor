From
The
Daily
Express
:

PUPILS
at
a
primary
school
were
forced
to
chant
“Allahu
Akhbar”
and
“there
is
no
God
but
Allah”
,
an
appalled
father
has
claimed
.

The
father
of
the
pupil
at
the
girl’s
primary
school
in
German
ski
resort
Garmisch
-
Partenkirchen
discovered
that
his
daughter
had
been
forced
to
learn
the
Islamic
prayer
when
he
discovered
a
handout
she
had
been
given
.

He
claimed
she
had
been
“forced”
by
teachers
to
memorise
the
Islamic
chants
and
forwarded
the
handout
to
Austrian
news
service
unsertirol24
.

The
handout
read:
“Oh
Allah
,
how
perfect
you
are
and
praise
be
to
you
.
Blessed
is
your
name
,
and
exalted
is
your
majesty
.
There
is
no
God
but
you
.
”

It
had
been
given
to
the
girl
during
a
lesson
in
“ethics”
at
the
Bavarian
school
.

What
are
they
going
to
teach
,
the
ethics
of
conquest
and
slavery
?

Here’s
another
story
from
yesterday
in
RT
:

Parents
of
a
German
teenager
may
face
a
trial
and
fine
for
“truancy”
after
refusing
to
allow
their
son
to
go
to
a
local
mosque
on
a
school
field
trip
out
of
fear
that
it
would
lead
to
his
“indoctrination”
by
Islamic
radicals
.

The
story
broke
in
mid
-
June
,
when
parents
of
a
13
-
year
-
old
student
opposed
the
idea
of
their
son
visiting
a
mosque
in
the
northern
German
town
of
Rendsburg
,
reportedly
organized
as
part
of
a
geography
class
.

In
a
letter
to
the
class
teacher
quoted
by
the
NDR
,
the
teen’s
father
argued
that
his
son
would
be
“indoctrinated”
in
the
mosque
.
He
went
on
to
say
that
“for
years
we
have
been
hearing
reports
about
religiously
-
motivated
violence
connected
with
Islamic
people
.
”

A
local
education
authority
subsequently
fined
the
couple
a
total
of
€300
(
$
328
)
,
referring
to
school
regulations
and
regional
laws
which
include
penalties
for
truancy
.

When
the
parents
opposed
the
fine
,
their
case
was
forwarded
to
Peter
Mueller
-
Rakow
,
a
local
prosecutor
,
who
will
decide
whether
or
not
to
proceed
with
a
court
trial
,
Spiegel
reported
on
Wednesday
.

The
parents’
lawyer
,
Alexander
Heumann
,
argues
that
they
refused
the
school
trip
out
of
fear
for
their
son’s
“bodily
safety
.
”

Denying
any
faith
-
based
motives
,
he
emphasized
that
the
couple
do
not
belong
to
any
religious
group
,
and
are
of
the
opinion
that
“nobody
shall
be
forced
into
a
sacred
place
against
his
good
will
.
”

…School
principal
Renate
Fritzsche
…
told
NDR
that
the
field
trip
to
the
mosque
was
meant
to
promote
tolerance
and
diversity
.

“We
also
have
Muslim
children
with
us
and
Muslim
parents
also
know
that
there
are
no
exceptions
,
”
she
said
,
adding
that
swimming
lessons
and
sex
education
are
compulsory
for
Muslim
children
as
well
.
“It
is
not
the
responsibility
of
the
parents
to
say:
‘My
child
will
attend
such
or
such
class
,
’”
Fritzsche
asserted
.

Intolerance
will
not
be
tolerated
