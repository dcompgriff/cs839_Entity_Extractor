Vigilantcitizen.com
reports:
The
Flint
water
crisis
began
exactly
two
years
ago,
on
April
2014,
when
Flint
changed
its
water
source
from
treated
Detroit
Water
and
Sewerage
Department
water
to
the
Flint
River
–
to
which
officials
had
failed
to
apply
corrosion
inhibitors.
Almost
immediately,
Flint
residents
complained
about
the
water’s
color,
taste
and
odor.
In
the
following
months,
numerous
water
issues
arose,
with
little
to
no
governmental
action
to
fix
them.
August
and
September
2014
boil-water
advisories
were
issued
by
the
city
due
to
coliform
bacteria
detection
On
August
21,
2014
test
showed
the
city’s
water
tested
high
for
THMs,
a
chlorine
byproduct
of
disinfecting
water,
with
which
long
term
exposure
has
been
linked
to
cancer
and
other
diseases.
Though
the
city
stated
that
the
water
was
safe,
the
employees
of
the
Flint
Public
Library
declared
the
water
undrinkable
after
noticing
that
the
water
from
the
faucets
and
toilets
was
discolored.
On
March
2,
2016,
it
was
reported
that
the
state
of
Michigan
blocked
Flint
from
returning
to
Lake
Huron
water
from
the
Detroit
water
system
when
it
agreed
to
grant
the
city
an
emergency
loan
of
$7
million
in
April
2015
It
was
discovered
that
the
high
levels
of
lead
were
due
to
orthophosphate
being
omitted
from
the
water
treatment
process,
while
using
a
pH
of
7.4
and
that
the
orange
water
was
due
to
the
high
concentration
of
chloride
in
the
Flint
River
water,
which
caused
excessive
corrosion
of
the
cast
iron
mains
pipes.
Far
from
taking
decisive
action,
governments
denied
that
the
water
was
toxic.
While
the
local
outcry
about
Flint
water
quality
was
growing
in
early
2015,
Flint
water
officials
filed
papers
with
state
regulators
purporting
to
show
that
“tests
at
Flint’s
water
treatment
plant
had
detected
no
lead
and
testing
in
homes
had
registered
lead
at
acceptable
levels.”
The
documents
falsely
claimed
that
the
city
had
tested
tap
water
from
homes
with
lead
service
lines,
and
therefore
the
highest
lead-poisoning
risks;
in
reality;
the
city
does
not
know
the
locations
of
lead
service
lines,
which
city
officials
acknowledged
in
November
2015
after
the
Flint
Journal/MLive
published
an
article
revealing
the
practice
after
obtaining
documents
through
the
Michigan
Freedom
of
Information
Act.
–

Erb,
Flint
doctor

see

about
lead
in
water
The
net
result
is
that
over
10,000
children
(mostly
Black)
were
exposed
to
water
contaminated
with
lead.
Lead
poisoning
has
devastating
effects
on
the
brain:
Childhood
lead
exposure
causes
a
reduction
in
intellectual
functioning
and
IQ,
academic
performance,
and
problem-solving
skills,
and
an
increased
risk
of
attention
deficit
disorder,
aggression,
and
hyperactivity.
According
to
studies,
children
with
elevated
levels
of
lead
in
the
blood
are
more
likely
as
adults
to
commit
crimes,
be
imprisoned,
be
unemployed
or
underemployed,
or
be
dependent
on
government
services.

A
massive
investigation
is
now
underway
and
lawsuits
are
being
filed.
And
things
are
turning
uglier.
Cover
Up
Now
that
the
federal
government
opened
an
investigation
on
the
issue,
news
emerging
from
Flint
are
downright
sordid.
First,
in
March,
important
documents
went
missing,
the
police
openly
admits
that
it
was
an
inside
job,
and
that
the
crime
will
most
likely
remain
unresolved.
Days
before
the
federal
government
opened
an
investigation
into
the
Flint
water
crisis,
someone
broke
into
a
vacant
City
Hall
office
full
of
documents
related
to
the
embattled
Michigan
city’s
water
system.
Nearly
three
months
later,
officials
have
confirmed
that
a
TV
went
missing,
but
little
else
is
known,
according
to
the
Flint
Journal
.
Without
suspects
or
a
firm
handle
on
what
else
may
have
been
swiped,
authorities
told
the
paper
last
week
that
the
crime
may
remain
unsolved.
No
warrants
have
been
issued
in
the
case,
but
officials
don’t
shy
away
from
speculative
statements
that
stop
just
short
of
conspiracy
theories.
“It
was
definitely
an
inside
job,”
police
chief
Tim
Johnson
told
the
Journal.
“The
power
cord
(to
the
TV)
wasn’t
even
taken.
The
average
drug
user
knows
that
you’d
need
the
power
cord
to
be
able
to
pawn
it.”
“It
was
somebody
that
had
knowledge
of
those
documents
that
really
wanted
to
keep
them
out
of
the
right
hands,
out
of
the
hands
of
someone
who
was
going
to
tell
the
real
story
of
what’s
going
on
with
Flint
water.”

The
mystery
surrounding
missing

files
at
Flint
City
Hall:
‘It
was
definitely
an
inside
job’
On
April
16th,
Water
Treatment
Plant
Foreman
Matthew
McFarland
(who
had
been
interviewed
regarding
the
water
crisis)
was
found
dead
at
the
young
age
of
43.
Cause
of
death?
Unknown.
Already
reeling
from
the
news
of
criminal
charges
against
one
of
its
workers
in
the
wake
of
the
Flint
water
crisis,
city
workers
are
now
dealing
with
the
sudden
death
of
a
foreman
at
the
plant.
Water
Treatment
Plant
Foreman
Matthew
McFarland,
43,
of
Otter
Lake
died
suddenly
on
on
Saturday,
April
16,
according
to
his
obituary.
The
Lapeer
County
Sheriff’s
Department
said
a
friend
found
McFarland
unresponsive
at
a
home
in
Otter
Lake.
There
were
no
signs
of
foul
play.
An
autopsy
did
not
determine
a
cause
of
death
and
police
are
awaiting
toxicology
reports.
The
investigation
remains
open.
“My
thoughts
and
prayers
go
out
to
Matt’s
co-workers,
his
family
and
especially
his
children,”
said
Flint
Mayor
Karen
Weaver.
“He
worked
for
the
City
of
Flint
for
more
than
18
years
and
we
thank
him
for
his
devotion
and
service.”
We
all
have
been
brought
together
by
this
water
crisis
and
we
are
all
mourning
his
death,”
Weaver
said
in
a
statement.
“In
lieu
of
flowers,
the
family
has
expressed
they
would
appreciate
donations
to
establish
a
fund
for
(his
children)
Vance
and
Ella’s
college
expenses.”
McFarland’s
death
comes
as
Flint’s
water
plant
deals
with
news
that
Flint
Utilities
Manager
Michael
Glasgow
is
one
of
three
men
facing
criminal
charges
in
connection
with
the
city’s
water
crisis.
Glasgow
is
accused
of
tampering
with
evidence
when
he
allegedly
changed
testing
results
to
show
there
was
less
lead
in
city
water
than
there
actually
was.
He
is
also
charged
with
willful
neglect
of
office.
Michigan
Department
of
Environmental
Quality
employees
Stephen
Busch
and
Michael
Prysby
are
charged
with
misconduct
in
office,
conspiracy
to
tamper
with
evidence,
tampering
with
evidence
and
violations
of
the
Michigan
Safe
Drinking
Water
Act.
Michigan
Attorney
General
Bill
Schuette’s
office
confirmed
that
McFarland
was
previously
interviewed
as
part
of
its
ongoing
investigation
into
the
city’s
water
crisis.

with
sudden
death
of
foreman
A
few
days
later,
a
19-year
old
woman
leading
the
Flint
water
crisis
lawsuit
was
found
shot
dead
in
her
home.
A
culprit
was
arrested.
Was
he
a
patsy?
A
woman
at
the
center
of
a
bellwether
Flint
water
crisis
lawsuit
was
one
of
two
women
who
were
shot
to
death
inside
a
townhouse
earlier
this
week.
Sasha
Avonna
Bell
was
one
of
the
first
of
a
growing
number
of
people
to
file
a
lawsuit
in
connection
to
the
Flint
water
crisis
after
she
claimed
that
her
child
had
been
lead
poisoned.
Bell
was
found
dead
April
19
in
the
2600
block
of
Ridgecrest
Drive
at
the
Ridgecrest
Village
Townhouses.
Sacorya
Renee
Reed
was
also
found
shot
to
death
in
the
home.
An
unharmed
1-year-old
child
was
also
found
inside
of
the
Ridgecrest
home
when
Bell’s
body
was
discovered
and
was
taken
into
custody
by
child
protective
services.
Police
declined
to
confirm
if
it
was
Bell’s
child
discovered
in
the
home.
“Sasha
was
a
lovely
young
woman
who
cared
deeply
for
her
family,
and
especially
for
her
young
child,”
said
her
attorney
Corey
M.
Stern.
“Her
tragic
and
senseless
death
has
created
a
void
in
the
lives
of
so
many
people
that
loved
her.
Hopefully,
her
child
will
be
lifted
up
by
the
love
and
support
from
everyone
who
cared
deeply
for
Sasha.”
Bell’s
case
was
one
of
64
lawsuits
filed
on
behalf
of
144
children
by
Stern’s
firm,
New
York-based
Levy
Konigsberg,
and
Flint-based
Robinson
Carter
&
Crawford.
The
lawsuit
named
six
companies
that
had
various
responsibilities
with
respect
to
the
treatment,
monitoring,
and
safety
of
the
Flint
water
prior
to
and
during
the
Flint
water
crisis,
according
to
her
attorneys.
The
case
also
named
three
individual
government,
or
former
government,
employees
who
played
significant
roles
in
the
alleged
misconduct
that
led
to
the
alleged
poisoning
of
thousands
of
children
in
Flint,
her
attorneys
claim.
The
Bell
case,
however,
played
an
important
role
in
determining
the
future
of
the
more
than
five
dozen
other
lawsuits
that
were
filed.

Everything
about
this
story
is
revolting
and
dirty
facts
are
emerging
from
everywhere.
However,
mass
media
largely
ignores
this
story.
Those
that
do
are
flooded
with
comments
about
“tin
foil
hats”
and
“conspiracy
nutters”.
It
is
as
if
shills
are
paid
kill
that
story
online
…
or
maybe
that
poisonous
lead
has
already
done
its
debilitating,
mind-numbing
job.
