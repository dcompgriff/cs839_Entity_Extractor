It’s
our
go
to
response
.
When
the
lights
are
out
and
the
floorboard
creaks
.
When
a
branch
taps
a
slow
waltz
against
the
window
pane
and
our
hackles
dance
a
primordial
shimmy
,
we
ask
the
question
.
The
oldest
question
.
“Is
there
anyone
there
?
”

Turns
out
,
the
answer
is
yes
.
Not
The
Alien
Contact
We
Expected

It
was
a
little
thing
really
.
Giant
leap
for
mankind
moments
often
are
.
There
were
no
ships
hovering
over
national
landmarks
,
no
grainy
footage
of
aliens
being
dissected
on
steel
-
gray
slabs
.
No
‘take
me
to
your
leader
moments’
at
all
.

No
,
our
first
potentially
legitimate
brush
with
alien
intelligence
came
as
one
might
expect
;
from
the
nocturnal
laboring
of
two
dedicated
scientists
.

It
was
the
kind
of
science
you
don’t
get
to
see
.
The
methodical
pace
,
the
slow
transition
from
hypothesis
to
data
that
is
the
hallmark
of
good
research
.
The
pair
painstakingly
surveyed
a
patch
of
sky
simply
because
it
was
in
need
of
surveying
.
They
examined
some
2
.
5
million
stars
,
and
in
doing
so
,
E
.
F
.
Borra
and
E
.
Trottie
of
Quebec’s
<[>Laval
University<]>
might
have
made
the
single
most
important
discovery
in
human
history
.

You
see
,
while
the
vast
majority
of
the
stars
they
examined
were
acting
in
exactly
the
way
they
had
expected
,
a
tiny
fraction
of
them
–
234
in
total
–
were
not
.

They
were
exhibiting
bizarre
modulations
that
defied
easy
explanation
;
they
could
not
be
attributed
to
any
known
natural
phenomena
.
Indeed
,
they
didn’t
look
natural
at
all
.

They
looked
like
someone
,
or
rather
something
,
was
attempting
to
communicate
with
us
.

Like
,
for
real
.

Because
these
were
the
kind
of
signals
that
one
might
expect
an
extraterrestrial
intelligence
(
ETI
)
to
use
if
they
were
attempting
to
communicate
with
us
.
they
were
using
the
oldest
known
method
of
attracting
attention
in
the
dark

They
were
shining
a
light
at
us
.
Great
Expectations

In
a
study
published
in
2012
,
Borra
had
proposed
this
very
approach
.
He
wrote
:
“Consider
an
extraterrestrial
civilization
that
is
more
advanced
than
ours
.
Let
us
assume
that
they
want
to
signal
their
existence
to
other
civilizations
.
This
is
not
an
easy
task
considering
how
vast
the
universe
is
.
The
best
chance
of
being
seen
is
by
being
accidentally
detected
during
astronomical
observations
.
They
know
,
on
the
basis
of
their
own
experience
,
that
a
scientifically
advanced
civilization
observes
the
sky
and
takes
spectra
of
astronomical
objects
.
In
particular
,
spectroscopic
surveys
are
carried
out
.
”

These
surveys
would
inevitably
reveal
the
very
same
modulations
that
the
two
Canadian
scientists
just
discovered
.
Utterly
dissimilar
to
the
usual
background
‘noise’
of
the
universe
,
once
detected
,
they
would
warrant
further
investigation
.
Like
ships
sailing
on
a
pitch
black
sea
,
an
alert
lookout
could
easily
differentiate
between
the
naturally
occurring
light
flashes
of
reflected
moonbeams
or
distant
lightning
,
from
the
frantic
signalling
of
a
nearby
vessel
.

At
least
,
that’s
the
theory
.

Still
,
there
was
yet
more
compelling
evidence
that
this
was
indeed
an
attempt
at
communication
.

The
234
stars
in
Borra
and
Trottier’s
study
all
had
one
thing
in
common
.
The
modulations
all
came
from
stars
very
much
like
our
own
Sun
,
the
only
star
that
we
know
for
certain
harbors
intelligent
life
.
Phone
Home
?

The
most
obvious
answer
is
that
we
need
to
dig
deeper
;
as
Borra
acknowledged:
“
Extraordinary
claims
require
extraordinary
evidence
.
”

The
need
for
further
research
notwithstanding
,
a
very
real
question
needs
to
be
explored
.
Could
we
,
and
indeed
should
we
,
attempt
to
communicate
back
?

The
practical
considerations
are
not
insignificant
.
The
signal
device
,
a
powerful
laser
of
some
kind
,
could
be
based
on
Earth
but
would
have
to
shine
its
beam
to
a
space
station
that
contained
mirrors
capable
of
redirecting
the
light
to
the
targets
.

Such
a
station
would
have
to
be
sent
on
a
long
lonely
voyage
of
around
614
astronomical
units
or
about
20
times
further
than
Pluto
,
something
Barros
described
as
being
:
“Not
an
overwhelmingly
large
distance
.
”

Indeed
the
distance
the
mirror
would
have
to
be
placed
would
scale
with
he
distance
of
the
civilization
we
were
trying
to
contact
.
Using
an
existing
technology
known
as
a
solar
sail
we
could
:
“Reach
Pluto
in
5
years
.
For
an
ETI
at
a
100
lt
-
yr
distance
from
Earth
,
the
(
mirror’s
)
location
would
thus
be
reached
within
10
years
.

An
attempt
to
reach
a
civilization
even
further
away
would
of
course
take
longer
,
perhaps
a
century
or
more
and
whilst
Barro
admitted
that:
“This
is
a
long
time
.
”

He
remained
adamant
that
it
was
not
:
“…Overwhelmingly
so
,
considering
that
the
ETI
civilization
may
be
thousands
of
years
older
than
ours
.
”

Humanity
then
,
is
on
the
cusp
of
being
able
to
send
similar
signals
ourselves
.
But
should
we
?
This
Island
Earth

According
the
Professor
Stephen
Hawking
,
it
might
not
be
such
a
good
idea
.
While
he
is
convinced
that
we
are
not
alone
in
the
universe
he
cautioned
that
:
“We
should
be
wary
of
answering
back
.
”

In
Hawking’s
view
,
a
meeting
between
two
civilizations
would
resemble
Christopher
Columbus’
historic
meeting
of
Native
Americans
.

Something
that
he
noted
:
“Didn’t
turn
out
so
well
.
”

Still
,
whether
we
chose
to
respond
or
not
remains
peripheral
to
the
sheer
magnitude
of
the
discovery
.
That
intelligent
alien
life
is
not
only
out
there
but
that
they
are
trying
to
say
hello
.
If
true
,
it
points
to
a
universality
of
at
least
one
pervasive
human
emotion
.

Curiosity
.

It’s
still
not
definite
;
it’s
still
only
a
‘probably
,
’
but
we’ve
never
been
closer
to
a
possible
answer
.
It
would
be
nice
to
finally
know
for
sure
.
After
all
,
we’ve
been
wondering
for
so
long
.

As
the
Epicurean
philosopher
and
poet
Lucretius
once
said
:
“Nothing
in
the
universe
is
unique
and
alone
and
therefore
in
other
regions
there
must
be
other
earths
inhabited
by
different
tribes
of
men
and
breeds
of
beasts
.
”

Yeah
,
there
must
be
.
