Hillary
Clinton
had
many
vocal
celebrities
on
her
side
during
the
2016
presidential
election.
However,
the
election
proved
that
most
Americans
just
don’t
care
what
celebrities
have
to
say
about
politics.
In
a
recent
interview,
comedian
Bill
Burr
blasted
arrogant
celebrities,
saying,
“Your
ego
is
so
f***ing
big
you
think
someone
is
going,
‘well,
I
want
to
vote
for
Trump,
but
if
he
gets
elected,
we
lose
Cher!’”
I
could
not
agree
more
with
what
Burr
said.
These
people
are
celebrities
and
have
no
knowledge
of
foreign
relations,
economics,
or
anything
other
than
entertainment
for
that
matter.
The
liberal
celebrities
feel
their
ability
to
read
a
script
translates
to
the
right
to
pontificate
on
the
most
important
issues
facing
our
country.
Liberals
have
had
Hollywood
in
their
pocket
for
years.
Other
celebrities,
such
as
Katy
Perry,
Robert
De
Niro,
and
Salma
Hayek,
all
came
out
to
support
Hillary
during
the
election.
Why
on
earth
do
these
people
think
anyone
will
change
their
vote
just
because
an
entertainer
threatens
to
leave
the
country
if
his
or
her
candidate
doesn’t
win?
Even
if
we
did
care,
we
all
know
they
won’t
really
move
their
entire
lives
to
live
in
another
country.
Case
in
point:
have
any
of
these
anti-Trump
celebrities
left
yet?
I
didn’t
think
so.
But
we
should
hold
them
to
their
vow!
Every
Hollywood
liberal
who
threatened
to
leave
the
United
States
if
Trump
was
elected
should
start
packing
their
bags.

Celebrities
only
demonstrate
one
thing
when
they
threaten
to
leave
the
US
over
election
results:
their
disgusting
arrogance.
Do
they
honestly
think
they
have
a
better
idea
about
the
economic
conditions
of
the
middle
class
than
those
actually
living
in
the
middle
class?
No.
They
just
think
they’re
entitled
to
the
support
of
their
fans.
If
they
could
come
down
to
reality
for
two
seconds
and
look
at
the
election
results,
clearly
regular
Americans
don’t
agree.
To
be
frank,
we
care
more
about
the
future
of
our
country
than
we
do
about
any
of
these
celebrities.
Don’t
worry—we’ll
remember
your
hypocrisy
and
self-absorption
when
you
threaten
to
leave
if
Trump
is
re-elected
in
2020.
