An
episode
of
Dr
.
Mark
Hyman’s
“
Fat
Summit
”
featured
the
work
of
Dr
.
Dale
Bredesen
,
who
specializes
in
researching
and
clinically
applying
his
research
on
those
afflicted
with
dementia
,
including
Alzheimer’s
.
Alzheimer’s
and
other
forms
of
dementia
are
considered
incurable
by
modern
pharmaceutical
dominated
mainstream
medicine
.

Fortunately
,
Dr
.
Bredesen
is
a
practitioner
of
functional
medicine
,
which
approaches
the
underlying
cause
of
any
disease
then
focuses
on
treatments
usually
involving
systems
of
holistic
or
alternative
medicine
instead
of
pharmaceutical
drugs
.

His
research
has
been
ongoing
for
27
years
to
determine
what
really
causes
dementia
and
Alzheimer’s
disease
(
AD
)
.
It
was
fun
witnessing
Dr
.
Hyman’s
energetic
,
fascinating
interview
of
Dr
.
Bredesen
.
Some
of
what
was
revealed
about
Alzheimer’s
was
quite
surprising
,
and
his
research
went
beyond
the
lab
to
confirm
his
team’s
findings
clinically
.

They
were
actually
diagnosing
root
causes
and
curing
the
incurable
with
natural
holistic
means
.
What
Dr
.
Bredesen
Discovered
About
Amyloid
Plaque

Amyloid
plaque
,
the
sticky
substance
that
interferes
with
neuron
transmission
and
destroys
brain
cells
,
is
commonly
considered
the
cause
of
Alzheimer’s
without
knowing
how
it
accumulates
to
begin
with
.

Dr
.
Bredesen
has
discovered
it
is
actually
a
protective
measure
created
by
the
brain
.
This
is
similar
to
how
cholesterol
rushes
to
patch
up
arterial
lesions
,
yet
is
considered
the
root
cause
by
modern
mainstream
medicine
for
heart
disease
.

Instead
of
reducing
cholesterol
with
statin
drugs
for
heart
disease
symptoms
,
it’s
wiser
to
get
to
the
root
cause
of
the
arterial
inflammation
damage
that
the
cholesterol
is
trying
patch
up
.
Both
Bredesen
and
Hyman
agreed
on
how
important
cholesterol
is
to
the
body
in
general
and
the
brain
in
particular
.

It
is
the
major
building
material
for
brain
tissue
and
the
protective
myelin
sheath
,
which
promotes
rapid
transmission
of
nerve
signals
to
all
parts
of
the
body
from
the
central
nervous
system
.

Various
independent
researchers
,
functional
medicine
practitioners
,
rogue
cardiologists
,
and
naturopathic
doctors
have
determined
that
most
arterial
inflammation
is
caused
by
excess
refined
sugar
intake
,
which
includes
artificially
synthesized
high
fructose
corn
syrup
(
HFCS
)
.

Dr
.
Bredesen
and
his
team
have
discovered
the
same
holds
true
for
amyloid
plaque
.
Instead
of
attempting
to
create
chemicals
for
removing
the
plaque
,
which
thus
far
has
proven
disastrous
,
why
not
discover
what
the
plaque
is
attempting
to
protect
against
and
treat
that
?
What
Invites
Amyloid
Plaque
to
Build
Up
in
the
Brain
?

Here’s
where
modern
medical
technology
combines
with
integrative
medicine
.
Dr
.
Bredsen
considers
it
a
“perfect
fit
.
”
State
of
the
art
neurology
and
biochemical
technology
is
used
to
determine
which
of
the
following
basic
issues
exist
,
then
natural
holistic
nutritional
sources
,
environmental
,
and
lifestyle
changes
are
used
to
eliminate
them
.

Here
are
some
of
the
basic
areas
discovered
that
can
be
remedied
without
pharmaceutical
drugs:

Inflammation:
This
can
be
caused
by
infectious
pathogens
but
more
often
by
environmental
toxins
such
as:
Mercury
–
dental
amalgams
and
other
sources
Sleep
issues
–
good
sleep
is
needed
for
the
brain’s
glymp
h
atic
action
to
purge
itself
of
toxins
Indoor
building
materials
and
mold
from
interior
dampness
in
homes
and
work
spaces
Chronic
sinus
issues
–
this
opens
up
the
potential
for
“nasal
probiotics”
Excess
simple
carbohydrate
consumption
–
refined
starches
and
sugars
Chronic
stress
–
a
common
denominator
for
many
inflammatory
conditions
Aspartame
–
commonly
used
neurotoxin
in
diet
sodas
and
other
processed
foods
as
a
sugar
substitute
Excess
alcohol
consumption
Insulin
resistance
–
some
consider
dementia/Alzheimer’s
diabetes

this
is
where
coconut
oil
comes
to
the
rescue

Insufficient
Brain
Nutrients:
Lacking
these
nutrients
needed
for
optimum
brain
and
memory
function
,
among
them
are:
Vitamin
D
–
the
aversion
to
sunshine
helps
create
this
very
common
deficiency
Vitamin
C
Vitamin
B12
–
methylcobil
a
ba
n
without
folic
acid
is
the
preferred
supplement
source
for
B12
(

)
Sex
hormones
–
oestrogen
and
progesterone
for
women
and
testosterone
for
men
that
need
to
be
sufficient
and
balanced
Omega
3
fatty
acids
–
sourced
from
pure
fish
oils
or
flaxseed
oil
or
ground
flax
seeds
,
our
processed
foods
are
top
heavy
with
transfat
omega
-
6
fatty
acids
Low
cholesterol
–
often
caused
by
statins
(

Toxins:
Some
are
already
listed
here
,
but
amyloid
plaque’s
network
of
protein
parts
is
also
an
attempt
to
remove
those
toxins
and
others
.
Detoxing
with
known
items
that
can
cross
the
blood
brain
barrier
was
proven
helpful
.

A
perfect
example
is
aluminum
from
vaccines
,
common
underarm
deodorants
,
and
other
environmental
sources
.
There
are
mineral
waters
high
in
ionic
suspended
silicon
that
penetrate
the
blood
brain
barrier
to
bind
with
and
remove
aluminum
.
The
most
recent
pervasive
environmental
toxin
in
the
food
supply
is
glyphosate
,
which
also
adversely
affects
the
brain
.
Conclusion

Remember
hearing
how
destroyed
brain
cells
never
come
back
,
the
brain
loses
that
portion
forever
,
once
a
brain
shrinks
that’s
it
?
It
has
been
medical
“common
knowledge
.
”
Dr
.
Bredesen
told
about
ordering
another
CT
scan
of
a
patient
who
had
been
under
the
clinic’s
care
.

The
radiologist
thought
it
was
a
waste
of
time
,
but
did
it
anyway
.
He
was
shocked
to
realize
that
patient’s
shrunken
hippocampus
and
other
parts
of
his
brain’s
memory
storage
had
grown
since
his
first
brain
scan
at
the
start
of
treatments
.
Another
medical
myth
shattered
.

Dr
.
Hyman
asked
Dr
.
Bredesen
to
provide
dramatic
clinical
success
using
their
resources
of
modern
technology’s
discovery
techniques
for
holistic
non
-
pharmaceutical
solutions
.

So
Dr
.
Bredesen
told
of
a
man
who
had
turned
70
and
was
so
bad
off
he
couldn’t
remember
with
whom
he
had
lunch
that
very
same
day
.
Friends
and
family
were
encouraging
him
to
sell
his
business
.
His
cognitive
and
memory
test
scores
were
among
the
bottom
five
percentile
.

After
holistic
treatments
,
his
test
scores
went
into
the
90
percentile
group
,
higher
than
most
younger
people
in
good
health
.
Instead
of
selling
his
business
,
he
added
another
store
.
All
this
success
without
pharmaceutical
drugs
.

Going
directly
from
animal
(
mouse
)
and
lab
culture
studies
to
human
clinical
testing
would
have
been
impossible
if
Dr
.
Bredesen
were
attempting
to
create
a
new
drug
.
Because
there
was
nothing
used
that
had
any
potential
dangers
requiring
expensive
human
trials
over
a
longer
time
,
he
was
able
to
put
his
discoveries
to
the
test
without
FDA
oversight
.

Since
Dr
.
Bredesen
is
a
neurological
expert
and
well
versed
in
biochemistry
,
he
tended
to
rattle
off
lines
of
technical
terms
that
would
confuse
most
of
us
,
but
not
Dr
.
Hyman
,
who
would
spontaneously
and
congenially
intervene
with
relaxed
layman
language
.

This
made
that
interview
go
smoothly
in
a
light
-
hearted
manner
without
confusion
,
yet
be
packed
with
information
,
not
all
of
which
I’ve
included
here
.
And
since
this
interview
was
part
of
the
“Fat
Summit
,
”
some
time
was
spent
on
discussing
the
role
of
fats
for
brain
health
.
Coconut
oil
with
its
high
percentage
of
medium
chain
lauric
fatty
acid
was
agreed
upon
as
an
ideal
dietary
fat
for
brain
health
.
