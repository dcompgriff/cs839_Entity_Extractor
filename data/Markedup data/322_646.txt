South
Korean
coast
guard
vessels
have
opened
fire
on
Chinese
trawlers
allegedly
fishing
illegally
off
South
Korea’s
coast
,
prompting
Beijing
to
censure
Seoul
.

On
Wednesday
,
senior
coast
guard
official
Kim
Jung
-
shik
said
the
order
to
fire
machine
guns
had
been
given
during
a
confrontation
with
some
30
Chinese
fishing
boats
.

The
Chinese
vessels
had
been
allegedly
operating
illegally
near
South
Korea’s
Yellow
Sea
border
with
North
Korea
on
Tuesday
.

“They
tried
to
ram
our
ships
although
we
repeatedly
warned
them
,
”
Yonhap
news
agency
quoted
Kim
as
saying
.

The
South
Korean
coast
guard
forces
initially
fired
into
the
air
but
were
later
ordered
to
fire
on
the
bows
of
the
trawlers
.

“I
thought
our
officers
would
be
in
danger
if
I
allowed
any
more
resistance
so
we
ended
up
using
the
crew
service
weapon
,
”
Kim
said
.

Two
Chinese
boats
were
seized
in
the
incident
,
which
reportedly
caused
no
casualties
.

The
machine
gun
shootout
is
the
first
of
its
kind
since
the
South
Korean
coast
guard
declared
in
September
that
it
would
apply
a
“more
aggressive”
firearms
policy
with
Chinese
boats
.

The
shooting
left
Beijing
“strongly
dissatisfied”
with
China’s
Foreign
Ministry
calling
on
Seoul
to
“discipline”
its
coast
guard
.

“Using
destructive
weapons
can
easily
hurt
fishermen
and
we
urge
the
ROK
(
South
Korea
)
side
to
…
avoid
using
any
excessive
or
extreme
tools
in
their
law
enforcement
activities
,
”
said
China’s
Foreign
Ministry
spokeswoman
Hua
Chunying
.

Numerous
incidents
have
occurred
in
recent
years
between
South
Korea’s
coast
guard
and
Chinese
fishing
boats
venturing
across
international
waters
in
search
of
fish
.

On
October
10
,
Seoul
said
it
had
lodged
a
formal
complaint
with
Beijing
over
the
alleged
sinking
of
a
South
Korean
coast
guard
vessel
by
Chinese
fishermen
on
October
7
.

On
September
29
,
three
Chinese
fishermen
died
after
their
fishing
boat
was
set
on
fire
by
South
Korean
coast
guard
members
who
threw
grenades
into
their
vessel
.
