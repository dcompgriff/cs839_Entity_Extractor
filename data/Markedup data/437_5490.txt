When
It
Crashes
,
It
Crashes
Harder
Nomi
Prins:
“The
financial
system
is
fragile
.
It
(
the
crackup
)
has
been
contained
for
8
going
on
what
will
be
9
years
of
cheap
money
,
bond
subsidization
,
banking
subsidization
,
and
of
a
codependency
that
is
very
fragile
.
I
don’t
know
when
that
gives
.
I’ve
tried
to
guess
this
throughout
the
years
,
but
the
point
is
that
it
only
increases
in
its
tension
and
its
(
ultimate
)
downfall
with
every
day
that
it’s
been
subsidized
artificially…

So
all
I
can
say
is
that
when
it
crashes
it
crashes
harder
the
longer
we
wait
for
that
crash
.
I
don’t
know
when
that
date
will
be
,
but
that’s
what
we’re
dealing
with
right
now
.

Eric
King:
“Nomi
,
people
around
the
world
will
send
in
emails
(
to
KWN
)
saying
,
‘I
want
to
be
protected
when
this
crash
unfolds
that
so
many
of
your
guests
have
warned
about
.
’
What
can
they
do
to
try
to
be
outside
of
the
system
?
I
know
we’ve
talked
about
this
in
the
past
but
what
are
some
concrete
things
that
are
simple
that
people
can
do
to
try
to
sidestep
that
dislocation
,
that
ultimate
unwind
?
Because
when
they
have
to
introduce
a
new
financial
system
,
if
you
are
trapped
inside
the
old
one
you
are
probably
not
going
to
get
a
very
good
transition
,
right
?
”

Nomi
Prins:
“No
,
and
that’s
why
I’ve
talked
about
trying
to
be
as
liquid
as
possible
and
keep
cash
out
of
banks
because
when
the
system
seizes
up
,
unlike
the
last
crash
,
unlike
the
last
crisis
,
it’s…To
