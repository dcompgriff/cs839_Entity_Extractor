Austin,
TX
-
A
local
babysitter
of
Mexican
descent
was
arrested
yesterday
for
failing
to
pay
taxes
on
income
earned
while
babysitting.
The
babysitter,
a
15-year
old
juvenile,
will
be
arraigned
in
Federal
court
on
Tuesday.

The
girl,
whose
name
is
being
withheld
due
to
her
age,
reportedly
earned
$1,800
from
babysitting
over
the
course
of
the
prior
tax
year,
and
is
a
full
time
high
school
student
with
strong
grades.

FBI
officials
tracked
check
deposits
made
at
a
community
bank.
Parents
all
reported
that
the
checks
were
for
babysitting
services.

The
income
should
have
been
reported
by
April
15,
subject
to
an
extension.
The
babysitter
is
also
being
charged
with
Social
Security
fraud
and
Medicare
fraud.

Local
FBI
officials,
led
by
Director
James
Comey,
applauded
the
new
initiative
modeled
after
the
policies
of
Donald
Trump,
stating,
"Here
we
are,
making
America
great
again!
Feeling
so
proud!
This
is
exactly
what
we
planned
for!"

One
FBI
insider
stated
anonymously,
"The
juvenile
was
brought
into
the
country
as
an
infant
illegally
and
based
on
her
tax
evasion,
she
is
a
criminal,
so
we
need
to
get
her
back
over
that
wall,
or
fence,
or
whatever
it
will
be,
just
get
her
back
to
Mexico,
let's
just
say."

Trump
denies
that
his
policies
imply
such
extreme
actions
and
denied
any
accountability,
tweeting,
"Comey
is
going
rogue
again."

Many
young
parents
are
disappointed
with
the
news.
The
juvenile
was
known
as
one
of
the
neighborhood's
most
popular
babysitters.

"Such
a
shock,"
stated
one
local
mother
who
would
not
give
her
name,
"Where
am
I
supposed
to
get
my
babysitting
services
now?"
