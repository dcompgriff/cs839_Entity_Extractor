Gun
Control
advocates
expected
to
advance
agenda
in
four
states
this
Election
Day.

Ballot
measures
to
control
gun
sale
and
ownership
in
Maine,
Nevada,
Washington
D.C.,
and
California
are
expected
to
pass
on
Tuesday.

In
Maine
and
Nevada,
residents
will
vote
on
whether
to
mandate
universal
background
checks
for
firearm
sales,
including
private
handgun
transactions.

Voters
in
Washington
state,
meanwhile,
will
consider
allowing
judges
to
bar
people
from
possessing
guns
if
they
pose
a
danger
to
themselves
or
to
others,
such
as
accused
domestic
abusers.
In
California,
a
referendum
would
ban
large-capacity
ammunition
magazines
and
require
certain
people
to
pass
a
background
check
to
buy
ammunition.

The
U.S.
Constitution's
Second
Amendment
protects
the
right
to
bear
arms,
and
gun
rights
advocates
fiercely
contest
any
attempt
to
restrict
that
freedom.

As
reported
by
Charisma
News
in
the
Spring
of
2016
investigative
author
and
activist
Mark
Dice,
during
a
"Man
on
the
Street
Monday"
videos,
asked
passersby
at
a
San
Diego
beach
if
gun
control
could've
prevented
the
death
of
Jesus.
The
results
gave
a
worrisome
state
of
America
today.
