Donald
Trump
may
call
the
2016
election
“rigged,”
but
a
consultant
connected
to
the
Great
America
PAC,
a
pro-Trump
super
PAC,
told
reporters
that
the
group
has
a
suppression
campaign
in
the
works,
believing
them
to
be
representatives
of
a
potential
donor.

Political
consultant
Jesse
Benton
is
once
again
in
hot
water.
After
journalists
from
The
Telegraph
introduced
themselves
to
the
former
Senator
Rand
Paul
(R-Kentucky)
aide
as
lawyers
representing
a
potential
Trump
donor
who
was
also
a
Chinese
national,
Benton
proceeded
to
not
only
tell
them
how
to
donate
to
Trump’s
campaign
despite
it
being
against
federal
election
law,
but
also
discussed
attempts
to
suppress
votes
in
Cleveland,
Ohio.

This
isn’t
Benton’s
first
time
engaging
in
politically
and
legally
questionable
behavior.
In
May,
he
had
to
take
a
step
back
from
his
role
at
the
Great
America
PAC
after
pleading
guilty
to
buying
an
endorsement
for
presidential
candidate
Ron
Paul
in
2012,
during
his
time
as
campaign
manager.
Benton
was
sentenced
to
two
years
of
probation.

The
undercover
reporters
first
contacted
the
PAC’s
co-chairman,
Eric
Beach,
who
was
filmed
telling
them
that
their
Chinese
client
would
be
“
remembered
”
if
Trump
becomes
president,
The
Telegraph
reported
.

Beach
proceeded
to
refer
them
over
to
Benton,
claiming
he
was
a
consultant.
When
they
met
with
Benton,
he
discussed
the
Trump
campaign’s
plans
in
the
swing
state
of
Ohio.
Referring
to
Hillary
Clinton’s
support
in
Ohio,
he
said:
“
In
Cleveland,
if
we
can...turn
her
to
regular
turnout
levels,
she's
gonna
lose
about
60,000
votes
in
that
area
–
that's
a
dead
heat.
”

“
So
we
have
a
voter
suppression
campaign
quite
frankly,
targeting
African-Americans,
and
sort
of
suburban
moms,
just
bad
stuff
about
Hillary,
just
trying
to
take
their
taste
for
her
away,
”
he
explained.

When
it
came
to
the
issue
of
how
the
Trump
campaign
would
be
able
to
accept
money
from
a
Chinese
national
without
arousing
suspicion,
Benton
explained
that
he
would
channel
the
cash
through
a
dark
money
tunnel.

Super
PACs
make
use
of
non-profit
organizations
to
collect
money
from
donors
because
501(c)4
nonprofit
groups
are
allowed
to
donate
funds
to
political
campaigns
without
disclosing
who
their
donors
are.
Benton
said
he
could
accept
the
offered
$2
million
contribution
from
the
non-existent
Chinese
donor
by
having
the
money
sent
to
his
company,
which
would
then
pass
it
on
to
one
or
two
more
non-profits.

Republicans
are
asking
for
their
donations

from

the
aftermath

The
Great
America
PAC
has
tried
to
distance
itself
from
Benton.
Dan
Backer,
a
lawyer
for
Great
America,
told
The
New
York
Times
that
“
I
think
it’s
pretty
clear
that
someone
who
used
to
work
for
the
organization
decided
to
leverage
that
former
relationship
for
his
own
purposes.
”

Backer
suggested
that
Benton
had
exaggerated
his
role
in
the
PAC,
telling
The
Telegraph
that
Benton
was
engaging
in
“
puffery
and
self-promotion.
”

Benton
has
denied
any
wrongdoing,
claiming
that
the
reporters
were
brought
to
him
as
a
“
business
referral
”
from
Beach
and
that
the
clip
was
actually
a
part
of
a
“
public
affairs
contract,
”
The
Telegraph
reported.

The
Trump
campaign
claims
to
have
severed
ties
with
the
PAC,
releasing
a
statement
saying
it
“
publicly
disavowed
this
group
back
in
April.
This
is
public
via
Federal
Election
Commission
filings.
”

However,
it
was
just
a
month
ago
that
Trump’s
son
Eric
and
former
New
York
Mayor
Rudy
Giuliani
spoke
at
a
Great
America
PAC
fundraiser,
