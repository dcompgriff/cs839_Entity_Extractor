The
persistent
investigation
of
Dr
.
Mikovits
into
the
cause
and
treatment
of
modern
illnesses
,
along
with
a
handful
of
other
scientists
and
healthcare
providers
such
as
the
late
Dr
.
Jeff
Bradstreet
,
M
.
D
.
,
is
leading
us
toward
a
new
understanding
of
modern
illness
and
its
treatment
.

Dr
.
Mikovits
sees
the
bigger
picture
of
health
and
illness
that
few
scientists
and
healthcare
providers
have
the
courage
to
examine
.
She
had
great
respect
for
the
work
of
Dr
.
Bradstreet
and
his
successful
use
of
the
new
paradigm
for
treating
difficult
illnesses
.
Dr
.
Mikovits
stated:

Dr
.
Bradstreet
recognized
that
what
we
call
autism
is
in
fact
an
acquired
immune
deficiency
.
What
we
know
of
as
autism
is
part
of
a
collection
of
more
than
60
diseases
that
is
spiraling
and
increasing
in
our
environment
.

It
is
acquired
immune
deficiency
resulting
from
all
the
toxins
,
all
the
vaccines
and
other
contaminants
in
our
environment
from
these
biologicals
that
in
fact
means
that
what
we
know
of
as
autism
spectrum
disorder
is
an
acquired
immune
deficiency
.

A
Family
of
Acquired
Immune
Deficiency
Diseases

Many
who
read
this
may
be
initially
confused
or
may
even
balk
at
the
use
of
the
term
Acquired
Immune
Deficiency
,
because
of
the
association
with
HIV/AIDS
.
HIV/AIDS
is
one
of
many
acquired
immune
deficiency
syndromes
(
diseases
)
.
It
is
an
acquired
immune
deficiency
caused
by
the
virus
that
is
commonly
called
HIV
.
However
,
HIV
is
not
the
only
acquired
immune
deficiency
disease
–
there
are
more
than
60
others
,
which
can
result
in
non
-
HIV
AIDS
.

When
the
human
immune
system
is
repeatedly
stressed
and
weakened
by
toxic
food
,
by
toxins
in
the
environment
,
and
by
toxic
vaccines
,
then
chronic
retrovirus
related
illnesses
can
begin
to
emerge
from
their
slumber
.
We
can
give
a
general
name
to
all
these
illnesses
.
We
can
simply
call
them
Acquired
Immune
Deficiency
Syndromes
or
non
-
HIV
AIDS
.

The
conventional
healthcare
system
struggles
to
accurately
diagnose
these
modern
diseases
,
because
there
are
so
many
overlapping
sets
of
symptoms
.
Beyond
the
specific
symptoms
is
the
same
underlying
problem
,
which
is
immune
system
dysregulation
and
dysfunction
.

People
with
these
diseases
have
immune
systems
that
have
been
pushed
to
the
max
by
various
stressors
.
Their
immune
systems
have
been
pushed
to
the
point
of
breakage
where
retroviral
infections
can
be
released
from
their
confinement
and
begin
to
reproduce
in
the
body
.

Once
this
happens
,
the
immune
system
is
no
longer
able
to
adequately
respond
to
the
insults
that
it
was
formerly
able
to
control
.
Various
immune
system
pathways
keep
trying
to
fix
the
situation
,
but
can’t
overcome
the
damage
.

An
acquired
immune
deficiency
is
simply
an
immune
system
that
has
been
broken
to
such
a
degree
that
it
cannot
properly
respond
to
the
conditions
that
are
causing
illness
.
It
is
so
broken
that
it
cannot
even
repair
itself
.
The
result
of
such
severe
immune
dysfunction
is
chronic
disabling
illness
.
The
Central
Tenet
of
Modern
Chronic
Illnesses

Dr
.
Mikovits
explains
more
about
the
new
understanding
of
the
immune
system
and
the
paradigm
shift
that
is
leading
healthcare
providers
to
reconsider
long
-
held
assumptions
about
health
and
illness
.
It
is
causing
them
to
rethink
what
it
means
to
bring
about
a
“cure”
for
modern
illnesses
.
Dr
.
Mikovits
stated:

The
paradigm
shift
was
recognizing
that
the
macrophage
was
the
central
tenet
of
disease
.
Our
central
hypothesis
,
which
we
have
held
for
more
than
three
decades
,
is
that
there
is
a
critical
threshold
of
immune
activation
,
and
when
the
activation
rises
above
that
level
,
damage
to
the
immune
system
is
being
created
.
Damage
is
created
at
a
distance
.

The
damage
may
be
subclinical
and
it
will
create
imbalance
not
only
in
the
macrophages
,
but
also
in
other
parts
of
the
immune
system
.
What
we
want
to
do
is
to
stop
this
process
.

We
want
to
stop
the
disease
engine
,
stop
the
microbial
switch
from
turning
on
the
oxidative
stress
,
and
turning
on
the
inflammatory
cytokines
—
and
doing
this
over
and
over
again
.
If
we
can
limit
the
damage
to
the
subsets
of
the
immune
system
,
then
it
is
possible
to
modulate
and
rebalance
the
immune
system
and
cure
the
disease
.

The
Power
of
the
Immune
System
can
Heal
Modern
Diseases

The
new
paradigm
offers
the
possibility
of
true
cure
,
because
it
relies
on
the
power
of
the
human
immune
system
to
bring
about
a
cure
.
Cure
is
not
seen
as
the
eradication
of
pathogens
by
pharmaceutical
drugs
or
other
means
,
rather
,
the
goal
is
to
restore
the
immune
system
so
that
it
can
once
again
control
or
manage
pathogens
.

In
the
case
of
retroviral
infection
such
as
HIV
,
HTLV
-
1
Leukemia
virus
,
and
others
,
these
viruses
cannot
be
eradicated
from
the
body
once
they
have
imbedded
themselves
into
human
DNA
.
Once
retroviruses
have
inserted
themselves
into
cells
,
they
cannot
be
removed
–
they
are
there
for
life
.

This
means
that
successful
treatments
will
need
to
prevent
further
viral
reproduction
and
enable
the
immune
system
to
control
the
existing
viral
load
.
When
this
is
done
,
then
the
symptoms
of
disease
subside
and
people
are
able
to
live
normal
lives
again
.

The
illnesses
we
are
discussing
first
appeared
after
the
dawn
of
the
genetic
age
or
they
had
a
sudden
increase
in
prevalence
since
it
began
.
Many
of
these
diseases
were
once
considered
only
diseases
of
the
elderly
;
but
today
they
are
appearing
in
children
and
even
in
newborn
babies
.
This
is
especially
true
for
cancer
.

We
are
seeing
babies
born
with
cancer
,
two
-
year
-
olds
dying
of
cancer
,
children
being
unable
to
digest
food
,
teens
dropping
dead
while
playing
sports
,
children
with
severe
physical
and
intellectual
delays
,
young
adults
in
their
twenties
with
disabling
neurological
failure
,
people
in
their
40s
and
50s
with
deteriorating
brain
function
and
memory
loss
,
and
people
of
all
ages
developing
brain
fog
and
physical
weakness
to
the
point
where
they
can
no
longer
work
or
even
take
care
of
themselves
.

Such
things
were
virtually
unheard
of
before
the
dawning
of
the
genetic
Age
.
The
Bad
Fruit
of
the
Genetic
Age

The
diseases
listed
below
are
some
of
the
illnesses
that
are
associated
with
retroviral
infection
and
immune
system
damage
.
We
cannot
say
these
diseases
are
caused
by
retroviruses
,
but
only
that
retroviruses
are
often
expressed
in
patients
who
have
these
diseases
.
Aberrant
retrovirus
expression
and
a
compromised
immune
system
are
the
common
threads
that
link
these
diseases
together
.
The
prevalence
of
these
diseases
has
increased
dramatically
over
the
past
four
decades
.

sign
of

dysfunction
in
these

is
extreme
fatigue
.
Many
people
also
note
unexplained
weight
loss
or

.
These
symptoms
are
early
warning
signs
of
cancer
,
but
also
are
hallmarks
of
all
the
other
diseases
mentioned

In
addition
,
there
will
be:
signs

Proper
Treatment
of
Immune
System
Dysfunction
can
Help
Patients

This
is
a
grim
reality
that
Dr
.
Mikovits
has
been
working
to
change
.

The
proper
treatment
of
immune
system
dysfunction
can
help
patients
with
these
types
of
illnesses
.
These
types
of
treatments
enable
the
body’s
normal
immune
defenses
to
take
up
their
task
and
gain
control
over
out
-
of
-
control
situations
in
the
body
.
Multiple
Factors
are
Causing
Illness
and
Death
in
Our
Modern
Age

These
are
some
of
the
major
factors
that
work
together
to
damage
immune
system
functioning
.
Alterations
in
human
DNA
caused
by
the
presence
of
retroviruses
,
Opportunistic
co
-
infections
that
accompany
retroviral
infections
,
Vaccines
and
most
pharmaceutical
drugs
,
Highly
processed
food
and
its
toxic
ingredients
such
as
GMOs
,
glyphosate
,
preservatives
,
artificial
flavorings
,
hydrogenated
oil
products
,
etc
.
,
Electromagnetic
pollution
,
Toxic
chemical
exposure
in
the
environment
,
Chlorinated
and
fluoridated
drinking
water
,
Biologically
inactive
and
chemically
contaminated
agricultural
soil
,
Antibiotics
and
incompatible
GMO
feed
given
to
animals
raised
in
confined
feeding
operations
,
Toxins
and
artificial
fragrances
in
cleaning
products
and
body
care
products
,
Mold
infested
homes
and
schools
,
and
Of
course
,
the
high
sugar
and
high
carbohydrate
diet
.

These
factors
,
plus
many
others
,
which
are
common
to
“modern
life”
in
America
,
interact
synergistically
to
damage
the
immune
system
.
The
combined
harm
is
much
higher
than
would
be
expected
by
simply
adding
the
potential
dangers
together
.
Over
time
,
the
stress
they
produce
on
the
immune
system
will
cause
it
to
crash
,
and
one
or
more
of
the
illnesses
listed
above
will
manifest
.

Conventional
physicians
cannot
seem
to
accept
the
reality
that
the
modern
diseases
that
plague
the
world
today
are
linked
to
multiple
factors
.
They
have
trouble
believing
there
is
synergy
between
these
factors
,
and
that
together
they
could
be
disrupting
the
human
immune
system
to
the
point
where
disease
results
.
Question
for
Dr
.
Mikovits

Is
Your
Approach
Really
New
?

Basically
what
I
am
describing
is
old
-
fashioned
medicine
,
and
it
is
rarely
done
anymore
.
There
are
some
,
of
course
,
who
do
use
these
protocols
.
We
need
to
look
at
the
patient
.
Talk
to
the
patient
.
Look
at
the
family
.
That
is
what
we
do
.
That’s
what
we
have
always
done
.

Based
on
the
fact
that
damage
to
the
immune
system
is
associated
with
a
complex
set
of
interconnected
factors
,
many
of
which
cannot
be
clearly
assessed
,
then
is
it
reasonable
to
think
that
the
selection
of
treatment
options
needs
to
be
based
more
on
the
dysfunctions
in
immune
system
pathways
,
than
on
the
potential
triggers
of
the
dysfunction
?

Yes
,
that
is
correct
.

There
are
any
number
of
therapies
–
both
natural
products
and
otherwise
–
that
could
be
put
together
to
address
immune
system
dysfunction
.
But
,
there
is
no
simple
fix
.
Physicians
tend
to
want
to
just
hand
a
patient
an
antidepressant
,
which
is
not
going
to
work
,
or
give
Lyrica
or
pain
medication
,
which
is
going
to
mask
the
problem
.
Even
steroids
mask
the
problem
and
prevent
immune
system
functioning
,
and
down
the
road
a
few
years
things
are
going
to
get
even
worse
and
spin
out
of
control
.

Treating
these
patients
is
a
lot
like
the
protocol
we
used
for
treating
AIDS
patients
.
If
the
AIDS
patient
had
TB
or
mycoplasma
we
couldn’t
treat
the
retrovirus
first
.
We
had
to
clear
the
terrain
.
We
had
to
stop
some
of
the
other
overwhelming
infections
and
prevent
the
downstream
effects
on
their
bodies
.
Otherwise
,
they
couldn’t
respond
to
the
treatment
.
What
we
learned
that
was
most
significant
was
to
never
let
the
CD4
T
cells
get
too
low
,
because
if
they
get
too
low
then
patients
can’t
respond
to
antiretroviral
or
antimicrobial
treatments
.

We
are
also
learning
which
microbes
in
the
human
microbiome
are
key
to
drug
responses
,
because
they
modulate
the
immune
system
,
interferon
and
things
like
that
.

Most
people
want
natural
products
for
their
illnesses
.
Baicalin
,
medical
marijuana
,
vitamin
D
binding
protein
(
GcMAF
)
,
and
HEEL
Lymphomyosot
are
some
of
the
natural
products
that
we
have
studied
.
The
New
Paradigm
must
Address
Vaccines
and
Vaccine
Injury

Big
Pharma
and
the
government
scientists
who
do
their
will
want
us
to
believe
that
the
science
regarding
vaccine
safety
is
settled
,
and
the
current
vaccination
schedule
is
safe
.
However
,
some
scientists
object
to
this
conclusion
and
insist
that
the
science
is
not
settled
and
the
schedule
is
not
safe
!

In
fact
,
the
science
that
has
been
produced
since
2010
concerning
vaccines
is
unsettling
Big
Pharma
.
It
contradicts
their
past
conclusions
and
is
threatening
their
profitability
.

Agencies
such
as
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(
CDC
)
and
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
have
lost
touch
with
their
original
mandates
to
protect
and
serve
the
public
.
These
U
.
S
.
government
regulators
continue
to
ignore
the
new
science
and
pursue
an
informal
program
that
discredits
scientists
who
expose
the
harmful
nature
of
current
vaccines
,
and
they
discredit
those
who
dare
to
criticize
the
CDC’s
recommended
vaccine
schedule
.

As
we
saw
with
the
MMR
vaccine
,
the
FDA
knowingly
approves
vaccines
and
drugs
when
research
shows
a
high
potential
for
harm
,
and
even
destroys
data
and
alters
its
findings
for
the
sake
of
keeping
its
corporate
funders
happy
.
[

While
the
FDA
is
keeping
its
head
buried
in
the
sand
,
the
CDC
is
promoting
a
schedule
of
childhood
vaccination
which
has
caused
harm
to
millions
of
children
.

Despite
this
level
of
corruption
,
strong
voices
can
be
heard
from
outside
the
corporate
and
regulatory
world
declaring
the
truth
about
vaccines
and
their
schedule
of
administration
.

Among
the
voices
raising
concern
about
the
safety
of
vaccines
and
their
schedule
of
administration
is
the
respectful
voice
of
scientist
Dr

Judy
A
.
Mikovits
,

D

She
continues
to
speak
out
on
the
mechanisms
of
immune
system
injury
and
the
treatments
for
retroviral
and
vaccine
related
illness
.
Her
clear
voice
is
a
wake
-
up
call
to
all
people
who
value
health
freedom
and
independent
thinking
.

Her
teaching
is
life
-
enriching
,
because
she
is
addressing
the
needs
of
real
people
with
serious
illness
,
and
is
speaking
directly
to
doctors
who
are
beginning
to
realize
they
need
new
tools
to
understand
and
treat
the
modern
illnesses
of
their
patients
.

Her
teaching
is
not
anti
-
vaccine
,
because
Dr

Mikovits
is
not
anti

vaccine
.
However
,
Dr

Mikovits
is
not
afraid
to
raise
serious
questions
about
the
safety
of
the
vaccines
being
used
today

She
is
not
afraid
to
give
a
strong
warning
about
the
vaccine
schedule
used
for
infants
and
children
,
and
will
not
remain
silent
about
the
lack
of
wisdom
associated
with
vaccinating
pregnant
women
and
seniors
.

Dr
.
Mikovits
allows
the
science
to
speak
.
She
works
hard
to
avoid
standing
on
the
pro
-
vaccine
or
anti
-
vaccine
soapbox
.
Instead
,
she
quietly
asks
us
to
use
our
intelligence
to
make
decisions
concerning
the
use
of
vaccines
based
on
everything
that
is
known
about
the
functioning
of
the
human
immune
system
and
its
reaction
to
vaccines
.
Dr
.
Mikovits
is
Challenging
All
of
Us
to
Wake
Up

Dr
.
Mikovits
is
inserting
a
healthy
dose
of
common
sense
into
the
discussion
of
vaccine
safety
.
She
stated:

You
will
hear
,
“the
science
is
settled
,
vaccines
are
safe
.
”
They
aren’t
safe
.
What
science
is
settled
?
We
learn
new
things
every
day
!

Dr
.
Mikovits
is
challenging
all
of
us
to
wake
up
.

Physicians
are
being
challenged
to
think
twice
whenever
they
consider
recommending
that
all
their
patients
receive
vaccines
according
to
the
schedule
promoted
by
the
CDC
.
The
general
public
is
being
challenged
to
think
twice
before
agreeing
to
receive
vaccines
or
permit
vaccines
to
be
given
to
their
children
.
Patients
are
being
challenged
to
engage
their
physicians
in
a
dialogue
about
the
potential
harm
that
might
result
from
being
vaccinated
,
because
vaccine
injury
is
a
real
possibility
whenever
a
vaccine
is
given
,
and
the
use
of
clever
marketing
slogans
such
as
“the
science
is
settled”
does
not
remove
the
possibility
of
vaccine
injury
.

Medical
Doctors
Opposed
to
Forced
Vaccinations
–
Should
Their
Views
be
Silenced
?
eBook
–
Available
for
immediate
download
.

One
of
the
biggest
myths
being
propagated
in
the
compliant
mainstream
media
today
is
that
doctors
are
either
pro
-
vaccine
or
anti
-
vaccine
,
and
that
the
anti
-
vaccine
doctors
are
all
“quacks
.
”

However
,
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
in
the
vaccine
debate
.
Doctors
are
not
unified
at
all
on
their
positions
regarding
“the
science”
of
vaccines
,
nor
are
they
unified
in
the
position
of
removing
informed
consent
to
a
medical
procedure
like
vaccines
.

The
two
most
extreme
positions
are
those
doctors
who
are
100
%
against
vaccines
and
do
not
administer
them
at
all
,
and
those
doctors
that
believe
that
ALL
vaccines
are
safe
and
effective
for
ALL
people
,
ALL
the
time
,
by
force
if
necessary
.

Very
few
doctors
fall
into
either
of
these
two
extremist
positions
,
and
yet
it
is
the
extreme
pro
-
vaccine
position
that
is
presented
by
the
U
.
S
.
Government
and
mainstream
media
as
being
the
dominant
position
of
the
medical
field
.

In
between
these
two
extreme
views
,
however
,
is
where
the
vast
majority
of
doctors
practicing
today
would
probably
categorize
their
position
.
Many
doctors
who
consider
themselves
“pro
-
vaccine
,
”
for
example
,
do
not
believe
that
every
single
vaccine
is
appropriate
for
every
single
individual
.

Many
doctors
recommend
a
“delayed”
vaccine
schedule
for
some
patients
,
and
not
always
the
recommended
one
-
size
-
fits
-
all
CDC
childhood
schedule
.
Other
doctors
choose
to
recommend
vaccines
based
on
the
actual
science
and
merit
of
each
vaccine
,
recommending
some
,
while
determining
that
others
are
not
worth
the
risk
for
children
,
such
as
the
suspect
seasonal
flu
shot
.

These
doctors
who
do
not
hold
extreme
positions
would
be
opposed
to
government
-
mandated
vaccinations
and
the
removal
of
all
parental
exemptions
.

In
this
eBook
,
I
am
going
to
summarize
the
many
doctors
today
who
do
not
take
the
most
extremist
pro
-
vaccine
position
,
which
is
probably
not
held
by
very
many
doctors
at
all
,
in
spite
of
what
the
pharmaceutical
industry
,
the
federal
government
,
and
the
mainstream
media
would
like
the
public
to
believe
.
