Beward
England,
drunken
maniacs
like
this
have
breached
the
border!

English
custom's
authorities,
police
and
military
are
on
red
alert
after
a
border
invasion
of
ginger-headed
(Not
Harry
he's
got
other
problems),
kilt
wearing,
whisky
smelling,
bagpipe
playing
Scots
entered
the
country
today
in
seek
of
revenge!

OK,
Brexit
was
hard
enough
to
take,
but
the
thought
of
losing
to
the
"Old
Enemy"
at
a
game
of
footy
in
Wembley,
tipped
the
scales
and
caused
a
full
scale
invasion!

In
the
night
thousands
of
wild,
pissed-up
Scottish
troops
were
thwarted
by
English
border
control
officers
as
they
scaled
Hadrian's
barb-wired
wall
(in
a
kilt?
OUCH!).
Others,
attempted
to
illegally
enter
the
country
through
needle-hole
border
controls.
The
queues
got
larger
and
larger
as
one
Scottish
rebel
known
better
as
Robby-Rave-heart,
stormed
a
barrier
formed
by
English
troops
single-handed
hurling
bottles
of
his
favourite
brew,
whisky
of
course,
donated
by
Jim
Beam
(?)
deemed
tasteless
and
worthless
compared
to
real
Scotch,
but
booze
is
booze
even
if
it
comes
from
the
US
the
Scots
say!

Tension
and
nationalistic
emotions
boiled
over
through
the
night
as
stubborn
English
troops
refused
to
surrender,
but
still
a
few
drunken
maniacs
got
through.
Scottish
National
Party
/
SNP
leader,
Nicola
Sturgeon,
then
entered
the
fray,
raised
her
kilt
revealing
her
pussy
dyed
in
family
tartan,
and
this
was
enough
to
shock
the
English
troops
into
surrender
as
a
Scottish
tsunami
forcibly
entered
England
and
is
now
heading
for
the
Sassenach
capital
in
full
force!

English
PM,
Theresa
May,
has
declared
England
a
disaster
zone
(has
been
since
1966)
and
warned
all
real-English
people
(are
there
any
left?)
not
to
confront
red-headed
maniacs
heading
south,
flashing
their
ginger
cojones;
they
could
be
life
threatening!
Make
Jaggedone's
day
-
give
this
story
five
thumbs-up
(there's
no
need
to
register
,
the
thumbs
are
just
down
there!)
