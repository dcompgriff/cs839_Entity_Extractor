This
composite
image
depicts
Jupiter's
cloud
formations
as
seen
through
the
eyes
of
Juno's
microwave
radiometer
(
MWR
)
instrument
as
compared
to
the
top
layer
,
a
Cassini
imaging
science
subsystem
image
of
the
planet
.
The
MWR
can
see
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
into
Jupiter's
atmosphere
with
the
instrument's
largest
antenna
.
The
belts
and
bands
visible
on
the
surface
are
also
visible
in
modified
form
in
each
layer
below
.
Jupiter's
stripes
are
more
than
skin
deep
,
according
to
observations
by
NASA's
Juno
probe
,
which
has
revealed
many
new
surprises
about
the
Jovian
giant
.
Juno
arrived
at
the
Jupiter
system
in
July
.
On
Aug
.
27
,
the
probe
made
a
close
flyby
of
the
planet
,
during
which
,
the
science
team
was
supposed
to
calibrate
Juno's
instruments
and
get
familiar
with
the
intense
environment
around
Jupiter
,
according
to
Juno
principal
investigator
Scott
Bolton
.
But
the
encounter
proved
more
fruitful
than
expected
.
Jupiter's
bold
,
colorful
stripes
are
clouds
,
and
optical
light
can't
penetrate
them
to
see
what's
underneath
.
However
,
Juno
is
carrying
microwave
instruments
that
can
each
probe
those
clouds
to
different
depths
;
together
,
these
instruments
can
effectively
peel
back
the
clouds
like
layers
of
an
onion
.
An
artist's
impression
based
on
the
microwave
data
reveals
a
striking
feature:
Some
of
the
stripes
are
visible
deep
into
the
cloud
layers
.
"
The
structure
of
the
zones
and
belts
still
exists
deep
down
,
"
Bolton
said
during
a
news
conference
at
the
2016
meeting
of
the
American
Astronomical
Society's
Division
for
Planetary
Sciences
.
"
So
whatever's
making
those
colors
,
whatever's
making
those
stripes
,
is
still
existing
pretty
far
down
into
Jupiter
.
That
came
as
a
surprise
to
many
of
the
scientists
.
We
didn't
know
if
this
was
[
just
]
skin
-
deep
.
"
The
new
images
penetrate
to
depths
of
about
200
to
250
miles
(
350
to
400
kilometers
)
below
the
surface
cloud
layer
,
Bolton
said
.
He
noted
that
the
bands
seen
on
the
cloud
tops
are
not
identical
to
the
bands
seen
in
the
subsequent
layers
,
although
there
is
clearly
a
strong
similarity
.
"
They're
evolving
.
They're
not
staying
the
same
,
"
Bolton
said
.
The
finding
"
hints
[
at
]
the
deep
dynamics
and
the
chemistry
of
Jupiter's
atmosphere
.
And
this
is
the
first
time
we've
seen
any
giant
planet
atmosphere
underneath
its
layers
.
So
we're
learning
about
atmospheric
dynamics
at
a
very
basic
level
.
"
Another
breathtaking
result
came
from
the
JunoCam
,
a
visible
-
light
camera
that
is
being
used
for
public
outreach
.
The
instrument
took
a
snapshot
of
Jupiter's
terminator
line
,
or
the
place
where
night
turns
to
day
.
As
is
the
case
with
viewing
the
moon's
terminator
line
,
the
change
in
light
casts
shadows
,
allowing
viewers
to
see
many
features
in
three
dimensions
(
like
being
able
to
see
the
depth
of
craters
on
the
moon
)
.
In
the
Juno
photo
,
scientists
spotted
a
cyclone
rising
above
the
main
atmospheric
layer
.
The
storm
appears
to
be
about
52
miles
(
85
km
)
tall
and
about
4
,
300
miles
(
7
,
000
km
)
wide
,
which
is
more
than
half
the
width
of
the
Earth
.

The
sunlit
part
of
Jupiter
was
created
by
a
citizen
scientist
(
Alex
Mai
)
using
data
from
Juno's
JunoCam
instrument
.
JunoCam's
raw
images
are
available
at
www
.
missionjuno

swri

edu/junocam
for
the
public
to
peruse
and
process
into
image
products
.
The
first
flyby
also
demonstrated
that
scientists
have
a
lot
to
learn
about
what's
happening
inside
Jupiter
,
the
researchers
said
.
The
Juno
team
discovered
that
very
close
to
the
planet
,
Jupiter's
magnetic
field
,
its
auroras
and
its
gravitational
field
(
that
is
,
the
characteristics
of
the
planet's
gravity
at
different
points
in
space
)
all
provided
surprises
.
The
auroras
on
Jupiter
,
which
were
first
spotted
by
the
Hubble
Space
Telescope
,
are
not
unlike
the
northern
and
southern
lights
that
flash
in
the
polar
skies
on
Earth
.
But
the
data
collected
by
Juno
on
Aug
.
27
has
thrown
into
question
the
models
scientists
had
for
Jupiter's
auroras
.
"
Nothing
about
the
aurora
that
we
measured
on
Aug
.
27
was
as
expected
,
"
Bolton
said
during
a
talk
at
the
meeting
.
The
probe
flew
over
the
auroras
with
multiple
instruments
turned
on
,
but
"
the
things
we
expected
to
see
weren't
there
,
and
things
we
didn't
expect
were
there
.
"
We're
sort
of
sorting
it
out
,
"
Bolton
said
.
"
We've
certainly
got
a
mission
of
discovery
[
with
regard
to
]
the
aurora
and
understanding
that
complex
system
.
"
In
addition
,
measurements
of
the
planet's
magnetic
field
matched
planetary
models
fairly
well
as
Juno
sped
toward
Jupiter
.
But
in
the
last
few
minutes
before
the
probe
reached
its
closest
point
of
approach
to
the
planet
,
the
data
drastically
diverged
from
the
predictions
,
showing
that
the
magnetic
field
was
much
stronger
than
expected
,
Bolton
said
.
That
implies
that
the
internal
magnetic
field
is
"
much
more
complex
than
people
thought
"
he
said
.
But
,
of
course
,
Bolton
noted
,
no
probe
has
ever
come
this
close
to
Jupiter
before
,
and
the
purpose
of
the
Juno
mission
is
to
gather
data
that
will
put
models
like
those
to
the
test
.
More
surprises
came
from
preliminary
measurements
of
Jupiter's
gravitational
field
(
that
is
,
the
strength
and
direction
of
the
planet's
gravity
at
different
points
in
space
)
.
Bolton
said
the
Juno
team
members
who
made
initial
models
of
the
planet's
internal
gravity
field
"
are
already
having
to
redo
the
field
model
"
based
on
those
early
measurements
.
"
The
internal
gravity
field
also
holds
a
lot
of
guarded
secrets
that
are
going
to
help
us
understand
Jupiter
,
"
he
said
.

An
infrared
image

of
Jupiter

NASA's
Juno
spacecraft
on
Aug

27

More
science
to
come
Juno's
orbit
around
Jupiter
isn't
circular
.
Instead
,
the
probe
makes
a
loop
that
takes
it
right
up
next
to
the
planet
—
to
within
3
,
100
miles
(
5
,
000
km
)
of
the
cloud
tops
—
and
then
far
out
into
space
,
before
looping
back
in
for
another
close
pass
.
Jupiter
is
surrounded
by
a
donut
-
shaped
ring
of
very
intense
radiation
that
could
easily
destroy
most
electronic
equipment
.
Juno
,
with
its
unique
orbit
,
does
a
thread
-
the
-
needle
maneuver
,
slipping
between
the
planet
and
the
radiation
ring
.
Right
now
,
Juno
makes
one
orbit
every
53
days
.
Juno
was
scheduled
to
fire
its
engines
on
Oct
.
19
and
reduce
its
orbit
to
every
14
days
.
Because
of
a
problem
with
the
engine
valves
,
the
Juno
team
has
delayed
that
engine
firing
until
the
issue
can
be
diagnosed
.
Juno
is
still
able
to
complete
its
science
mission
if
it
stays
in
the
53
-
day
orbit
,
Bolton
said
.
