Breaking
News
By

November

2016

There’s
a
false
narrative
floating
around
on
the
internet
about
Donald
Trump
being
anti
-
gay
and
racist
.

This
could
not
be
further
from
the
truth
.

Lynne
Patton
,
a
strong
,
bold
black
female
executive
at
Trump
Organization
and
Vice
President
of
The
Eric
Trump
Foundation
became
a
power
player
in
the
election
when
she
wrote
an
amazing
open
letter
about
her
experience
working
for
the
Trump
family
.

The
letter
,
which
was
turned
into
a
video
,
went
viral
.

Please
watch:

After
the
election
,
Lynne
wrote
a
compelling
and
powerful
Facebook
message
to
her
dear
friends
and
family
who
supported
Hillary
.

Her
heartfelt
words
speak
to
the
TRUE
character
of
Mr
.
Trump
–
not
the
lying
,
false
narrative
spread
by
our
dishonest
,
North
Korea
-
style
,
government
-
run
propaganda
media
that
existed
solely
to
help
Hillary
Clinton
get
elected
.

I
agree
with
Lynne
.

Donald
Trump’s
America
First
agenda
is
an
all
-
inclusive
movement
for
every
American
–
all
races
,
colors
,
genders
,
and
sexual
preference
.

Mr
.
Trump
is
a
“big
tent”
type
of
man
–
the
more
the
merrier
!

He’s
the
first
candidate
to
appeal
to
such
a
wide
variety
of
people
from
so
many
differing
walks
of
life
.

Donald
Trump
is
the
first
Republican
to
invite
an
openly
gay
man
,
Peter
Theil
,
the
co
-
founder
of
Paypal
,
to
be
a
keynote
speaker
at
the
GOP
convention
.

In
addition
,
Mr
.
Theil
is
also
an
intricate
part
of
President
-
elect
Trump’s
transition
team
.

Of
course
,
the
media
portrays
Trump’s
movement
as
racist
,
and
bigoted
–
a
basket
of
deplorable
mean
people
–
but
that’s
not
true
.

We
are
a
melting
pot
of
differing
views
and
cultures
who
have
come
together
to
take
our
country
back
from
establishment
globalists
who
,
for
decades
,
have
destroyed
the
country
.

Mr
.
Trump
understands
that
we
are
a
country
divided
.

The
people
protesting
the
election
right
now
are
hurt
.

It’s
understandable
–
their
candidate
lost
.

However
,
what
we
hope
,
as
we
move
forward
,
is
that
these
folks
will
keep
an
open
mind
and
an
open
heart
to
the
positive
ideas
and
exciting
changes
that
Mr
.
Trump
has
in
store
for
the
country
–
stimulating
the
economy
,
bringing
back
jobs
,
providing
everyone
a
safer
and
more
secure
country
,
and
much
more
!

I
don’t
work
for
the
Trump
family
,
but
as
someone
who
is
deeply
involved
with
the
Trump
“Online
Army
,
”
I
can
tell
you
that
Donald
Trump’s
LGBT
support
is
real
and
it’s
powerful
.

…
.
and
with
good
reason
.

Mr
.
Trump
is
a
loving
man
who
is
looking
out
for
the
well
-
being
of
the
gay
community
when
he
strongly
condemned
Hillary
Clinton
for
taking
money
from
,
and
supporting
countries
like
Saudi
Arabia
and
Qatar
,
who
routinely
persecute
,
abuse
,
and
execute
gays
.

Mr
.
Trump
challenged
Hillary
to
return
the
money
to
these
abusive
countries
as
a
symbol
of
support
for
the
LGBT
community
.

And
what
did
Hillary
do
?

She
laughed
.

This
is
a
man
who
vowed
to
halt
Muslim
refugees
hailing
from
parts
of
the
world
that
are
terror
hotbeds
and
foster
anti
-
gay
cultures
.

Mr
.
Trump
is
not
perfect
–
no
one
is
–
but
he
truly
wants
to
be
everyone’s
President
.

So
,
to
the
protesters
and
the
folks
who
feel
apprehensive
–
it’s
ok
and
understandable
to
feel
angry
and
sad
,
and
express
yourself
lawfully
-
but
when
you’re
done
,
please
give
America
First
a
chance
–
I
think
you’ll
be
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
great
it
will
be
.
