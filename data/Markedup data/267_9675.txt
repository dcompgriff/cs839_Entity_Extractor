C.E.
Dyer
reports
that
a
sickening
13,000
late-term
abortions
are
carried
out
every
year
in
the
U.S.
and
at
the
third
and
final
presidential
debate
on
Wednesday
night,
Democrat
nominee
Hillary
Clinton
explained
away
her
support
of
murdering
children
via
late-term
and
partial
birth
abortions
with
the
incorrect
claim
that
the
“life
and
health
of
the
mother”
is
often
at
stake
in
such
cases.

“The
kinds
of
cases
that
fall
at
the
end
of
pregnancy
are
often
the
most
heartbreaking,
painful
decisions
for
families
to
make,”
Clinton
said
at
the
debate,
referencing
health
risks
to
mothers
and
fetal
anomalies
to
justify
her
extreme
position.

Lila
Rose,
pro-life
activist
and
founder
of
Live
Action,
wrote
for
the
Hill
in
response
to
Clinton’s
dangerous
and
incorrect
statements:

The
first
problem
with
Clinton’s
claim
is
that
research
published
by
the
pro-abortion
Guttmacher
Institute
found
that
abortions
for
fetal
abnormalities
“make
up
a
small
minority”
of
late-term
abortions,
and
those
that
are
purported
to
be
done
to
save
the
mother’s
life
are
an
even
smaller
number.
Even
more
problematic
for
Clinton,
over
1,000
medical
professionals
have
concluded
that
abortion
is
never
medically
necessary
to
save
a
mother’s
life.
While
a
life-saving
treatment
for
a
mother
may
result
in
the
death
of
her
preborn
child,
that
treatment’s
purpose
is
not
to
kill
the
baby.
For
example,
removing
a
mother’s
fallopian
tube
in
the
case
of
an
ectopic
pregnancy,
or
inducing
labor
later
in
pregnancy
to
achieve
better
outcomes
for
both
baby
and
mother
is
not
abortion.
Not
being
able
to
save
someone
because
we
lack
the
technology
to
do
so
is
entirely
different
from
intentionally
killing
them.
Abortion
is
an
intentional
killing,
and
that
is
always
a
grave
injustice.

Rose
went
on
to
note
how
disturbing
it
is
that
Clinton
would
justify
the
murder
of
a
child
because
he
or
she
has
a
medical
condition.
Down
Syndrome
Awareness
Month
of
October
is
being
celebrated
by
millions
of
people
as
Clinton
justified
their
murder
because
someone
decided
they
aren’t
worthy
of
life.

Abortion
is
legal
throughout
all
nine
months
of
pregnancy
in
the
U.S.
for
certain
exceptions
—
a
fact
that
many
people
might
not
know
and
would
be
appalled
to
find
out.
As
Rose
reported,
some
states
have
restrictions
on
the
barbaric
practice,
but
seven
states
and
the
District
of
Columbia
allow
abortion
for
any
reason
at
any
time
in
the
pregnancy.

Rose
discussed
the
barbarism
that
is
late-term
and
partial-birth
abortion:

Most
late-term
abortions
are
induction
abortions,
committed
by
using
a
long
needle
to
pierce
a
baby’s
brain
or
heart
to
deliver
a
lethal
dose
of
digoxin,
which
causes
cardiac
arrest.
The
baby
is
then
delivered
stillborn
two
to
three
days
later.
You
can
see
a
medically
accurate
animation
of
this
procedure
presented
by
former
abortionist
Dr.
Anthony
Levatino
here
.

The
federal
law
banning
partial-birth
abortions
(which
Clinton
voted
against
as
a
senator
because
she
said
it
was
too
strict)
still
allows
for
the
abortionist
to
partially
deliver
a
child
—
with
her
legs
dangling
outside
of
her
mother
or
most
of
her
head
being
delivered
—
before
he
kills
her.
But
for
the
abortionist
waiting
to
take
the
child’s
life
as
she
moves
through
the
birth
canal,
the
child
is
only
seconds
away
from
taking
her
first
breath
and
having
full
legal
protection.

Clinton
supports
this
horrific
practice
and
Planned
Parenthood
—
which
kills
320,000
babies
a
year
as
the
largest
abortion
chain
in
the
country
—
supports
her
candidacy
in
return.
Planned
Parenthood
has
given
$30
million
to
the
Clinton
campaign
in
an
effort
to
save
the
$500
million
in
taxpayer
subsidies
they
receive
to
wage
war
on
the
preborn
and
the
moral
dignity
of
this
nation.
