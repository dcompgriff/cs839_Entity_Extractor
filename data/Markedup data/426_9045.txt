As
protesters
continue
to
stand
against
the
proposed
Dakota
Access
Pipeline
in
North
Dakota
,
facing
off
against
heavily
militarized
police
and
their
water
cannons
,
rubber
bullets
,
tear
gas
,
and
tasers
,
they
have
gained
broad
support
.
Celebrities
and
millions
of
social
media
users
have
raised
awareness
about
the
situation
in
North
Dakota
,
and
now
,
the
“water
protectors”
have
earned
support
from
another
group:
veterans
.

According
to
an
article
published
by
Business
Insider
that
first
appeared
in
Task
and
Purpose
,
a
military
-
oriented
news
and
culture
site
,
two
veterans
are
leading
the
charge
in
a
show
of
dissent
against
the
increasingly
aggressive
police
.
In
the
last
several
months
,
tensions
have
escalated
as
Natives
and
their
allies
have
blocked
the
pipeline’s
construction
,
citing
fears
surrounding
water
will
be
endangered
and
sacred
burial
sites
will
be
destroyed
(
not
to
mention
the
fact
their
lands
were
forcibly
stolen
by
the
U
.
S
.
government
over
a
century
ago
)
.

“This
country
is
repressing
our
people
,
”
says
Michael
A
.
Wood
Jr
.
,
a
Marine
Corps
veteran
who
recently
retired
from
the
Baltimore
police
force
to
work
toward
reforming
law
enforcement
.
“
If
we’re
going
to
be
heroes
,
if
we’re
really
going
to
be
those
veterans
that
this
country
praises
,
well
,
then
we
need
to
do
the
things
that
we
actually
said
we’re
going
to
do
when
we
took
the
oath
to
defend
the
Constitution
from
enemies
foreign
and
domestic
,
”
he
asserted
about
his
plans
to
go
to
Standing
Rock
.

Woods
Jr
.
is
joined
by
Wes
Clark
Jr
.
Clark
Jr
.
is
the
son
of
General
Wesley
Clark
,
the
famous
military
leader
who
once
warned
that
shortly
after
9/11
,
the
government
had
its
eyes
on
Iraq
,
Syria
,
Lebanon
,
Libya
,
Somalia
,
Sudan
,
and
Iran
.
Clark
would
later
attempt
to
distance
himself
from
those
statements
but
still
managed
to
convince
his
son
,
a
member
of
the
Army
at
the
time
,
to
stay
away
from
Iraq
.

“
I
was
like
,
‘I’m
going
back
in
.
I’m
going
to
go
in
there
and
fuck
people
up
,
’”
Clark
Jr
.
recalls
of
his
desire
to
fight
for
the
military
after
9/11
.
He
later
changed
his
mind
after
his
father
warned
him
,
as
Task
and
Purpose
summarized
,
“
that
as
a
soldier
he
would
be
fighting
a
war
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
defeating
al
Qaeda
.
”

Now
,
Wood
Jr
.
and
Clark
Jr
.
are
attempting
to
organize
a
mass
,
nonviolent
protest
against
police
action
in
North
Dakota
.
Just
this
past
weekend
,
a
female
protester
was
hit
with
a
concussion
grenade
,
causing
severe
damage
to
her
arm
and
requiring
surgery
.

Other
have
been
tear
gassed
,
tased
,
beaten
,
and
shot
with
rubber
bullets
.
Anti
-
Media
journalist
Derrick
Broze
was
tased
by
law
enforcement
immediately
after
he
declared
he
was
a
member
of
the
media
.
Another
journalist
was
shot
with
a
rubber
bullet
while
standing
away
from
a
gathering
of
protesters
as
she
interviewed
an
attendee
.

Police
have
made
over
470
arrests
since
August
,
and
the
Indigenous
Environmental
Network
claims
167
people
were
injured
just
this
past
Sunday
when
police
deployed
water
cannons
in
freezing
weather
.

Clark
,
a
contributor
to
the
Young
Turks
,
explained
that
aside
from
the
flagrant
violations
protesters
are
subject
to
in
North
Dakota
,
Natives
are
especially
deserving
of
veteran
support:

“
First
Americans
have
served
in
the
Unites
States
Military
,
defending
the
soil
of
our
homelands
,
at
a
greater
percentage
than
any
other
group
of
Americans
.
There
is
no
other
people
more
deserving
of
veteran
support
,
”
he
said
.

According
to
a
Facebook
event
the
two
men
created
called
“Veterans
Stand
for
Standing
Rock
,
”
those
who
join
the
effort
will
arrive
at
the
protest
site
on
December
4
,
where
they
will
stay
until
December
7
.

The
event
description
reads:

“
Come
to
Standing
Rock
Indian
Reservation
and
hold
the
line
with
Wes
Clark
jr
,
Michael
Wood
Jr
,
Tulsi
Gabbard
and
hundreds
of
other
veterans
in
support
of
the
Sioux
nation
against
the
DAPL
pipeline
.
Bring
Body
armor
,
gas
masks
,
earplugs
AND
shooting
mufflers
(
we
may
be
facing
a
sound
cannon
)
but
no
drugs
,
alcohol
or
weapons
.
”

Clark
Jr
.
was
clear
he
was
not
looking
for
violence
and
that
the
protest
would
be
unarmed
.

“
We’re
not
going
out
there
to
get
in
a
fight
with
anyone
,
”
he
said
.
“
They
can
feel
free
to
beat
us
up
,
but
we’re
100
%
nonviolence
.
”

As
Task
and
Purpose
explained:

“
With
an
eye
toward
the
media
,
old
military
uniforms
will
be
donned
so
that
if
the
veterans
are
brutalized
by
the
police
,
they
are
brutalized
not
as
ordinary
citizens
,
but
as
people
who
once
served
the
government
they
are
protesting
against
.
”

The
event
page
makes
it
clear
that
the
group
will
not
tolerate
“
hate
,
violence
or
divisive
behavior
of
any
kind
.
”

“
We’re
doing
this
to
support
our
country
,
”
they
advise
,
“
so
let’s
do
it
with
honor
,
working
together
.
We
can
stop
this
savage
injustice
being
committed
right
here
at
home
.
If
not
us
,
who
?
If
not
now
,
when
?
”

Over
250
veterans
have
already
committed
,
but
organizers
hope
to
have
a
group
of
500
or
more
by
the
time
they
head
to
Standing
Rock
.

Once
there
,
the
veterans
intend
to
engage
in
a
traditional
native
healing
ceremony
with
protesters
,
with
whom
they
have
been
coordinating
,
according
to
the
veterans
.
Then
,
protective
gear
like
gas
masks
and
body
armor
will
be
issued
to
anyone
who
needs
it
.
The
soldiers
will
march
to
bagpipes
and
Sioux
war
songs
as
they
head
to
the
banks
of
the
Missouri
River
to
meet
police
.

“
Then
,
the
veterans
and
their
allies
—
or
at
least
the
ones
who
are
brave
enough
—
will
lock
arms
and
cross
the
river
in
a
‘massive
line’
for
their
‘first
encounter’
with
the
‘opposing
forces
.
’”

Though
the
veterans
have
adopted
a
strict
policy
of
nonviolence
,
they
refuse
to
back
down
and
apparently
hope
to
use
their
military
status
to
spotlight
the
egregious
behavior
of
the
police
.

“
We’ll
have
those
people
who
will
recognize
that
they’re
not
willing
to
take
a
bullet
,
and
those
who
recognize
that
they
are
,
”
says
Wood
Jr
.
“
It’s
okay
if
some
of
them
step
back
,
but
Wes
and
I
have
no
intention
of
doing
so
.
