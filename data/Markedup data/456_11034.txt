is
on

alert
over
concerns
that

reports
Yonhap
News
Agency

Military
officials
suggest
that
the
North
may
attempt
another
launch
one
of
its
Musudan
intermediate

missile
(
IRBM
)

and
South
Korean
troops
on
the
Korean
peninsula
were
the
North
to
attack
its
southern
neighbor
.
South
Korea’s
military
noted
that
Pyongyang
may
want
to
present
a
show
of
force
to
demonstrate
that
it
will
continue
its
nuclear
and
ballistic
missile
programs
despite
pressure
from
the
U

S

and
the
international
community
.

“Doing
a
major
test
would
be
a
way
of
trying
to
intimidate
the
incoming
president
,
”
Victor
Cha
,
senior
adviser
and
Korea
chair
at
the
Center
for
Strategic
and
International
Studies
,
previously
told
CNN
,
“North
Korea
chooses
particular
windows
that
they
know
will
gain
maximum
attention
from
the
world
,
and
the
US
in
particular
.
”

North
Korea
has
historically
attempted
to
stir
up
trouble
around
U

elections
,
CNN
explained
,
citing
a
recent
CSIS
study
on
North
Korea
and
its
provocations
.

“We
are
closely
watching
every
move
by
the
North
Korean
military
at
its
Punggye
-
ri
nuclear
test
site
and
other
possible
missile
-
launching
sites
.
The
military
is
fully
prepared
to
respond
to
any
provocative
acts
by
the
North
,
”
an
official
from
South
Korea’s
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff
(
JCS

revealed
to

to
arm
themselves
with

“fight

U

S
.
officials
have
also
indicated
that
the
North
may
attempt
another
missile
launch
prior
to
or
during
the
election
.
It
is
unclear
,
however
,
whether
the
North
is
prepared
to
carry
out
such
a
test
.

North
Korea
has
conducted
eight
Musudan
IRBM
tests
with
only
one
success
.
The
two
most
recent
tests
were
failures
which
damaged
some
of
the
Korean
People’s
Army’s
launch
equipment
.

“While
there
has
been
speculation
of
a
North
Korean
satellite
launch
or
nuclear
test
occurring
during
the
run
-
up
to
the
US
Presidential
election
,
the
evidence
from
commercial
satellite
imagery
of
the
Sohae
Satellite
Launching
Station
and
the
Punggye
-
ri
nuclear
test
site
suggests
it’s
possible
but
unlikely
,
”

,
a
blog
run
by
the
U
.
S
.
-Korea
Institute
at
SAIS
,
argued
.

The
U
.
S
.
-based
think
tank
did
,
however
,
note
that
there
has
been
some
activity
around
the
North
Portal
at
the
Punggye
-
ri
nuclear
test
site
and
that
North
Korea
could
conduct
a
nuclear
test
on
short
notice
.

Pyongyang
has
not
made
any
public
threats
,
but
that
does
not
preclude
the
possibility
of
an
election
day
surprise
from
North
Korea
