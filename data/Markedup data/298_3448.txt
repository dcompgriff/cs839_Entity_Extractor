Ukrainian
law
enforcement
and
security
agencies
are
preparing
for
possible
protest
actions
in
the
country
.
A
headquarters
for
responding
to
a
surge
of
protest
activities
has
been
established
at
the
base
of
the
<[>National
Security
and
Defense
Committee
of
Ukraine<]>
.
This
has
been
confirmed
by
Ukrainian
journalists
close
to
the
headquarter’s
structures
.
Among
the
planned
measures
is
a
crackdown
on
protest
actions
and
the
introduction
of
martial
law
in
Kiev
if
the
situation
deteriorates
to
armed
confrontation
.
The
headquarters
is
headed
by
the
national
security
committee’s
secretary
,
Alexander
Turchynov
.
According
to
insider
sources
,
the
special
structure
also
includes
Defense
Minister
Arsen
Avakov
,
General
Prosecutor
Yuri
Lutsenko
,
Chief
of
General
Staff
Viktor
Muzhenko
,
SBU
and
intelligence
representatives
,
and
also
people’s
deputy
Sergey
Pashinsky
.
The
first
meeting
of
the
headquarters
took
place
on
Sunday
at
the
presidential
administration
.
Several
resolutions
were
adopted
.
The
police
have
been
ordered
not
to
allow
vehicles
transporting
protesters
into
the
capital
.
Kiev
authorities
and
law
enforcement
have
been
ordered
to
by
all
means
prevent
equipment
and
tents
from
being
set
up
on
the
Maidan
.
The
municipality
is
supposed
to
seek
a
court
ban
on
holding
mass
actions
in
the
center
of
the
capital
in
order
to
enact
this
.
MP’s
from
the
coalition
factions
in
parliament
(
the
Petro
Poroshenko
Bloc
and
People’s
Front
)
have
been
suggested
to
organize
private
security
detachments
out
of
athletes
and
staff
to
help
security
forces
disperse
actions
if
necessary
.
<[>Intelligence
services<]>
and
the
<[>SBU<]>
have
been
tasked
with
investigating
evidence
of
a
“Russian
trace”
in
the
planned
protests
.
They
have
also
been
instructed
to
look
into
shutting
down
TV
channels
and
blocking
internet
sites
.
If
all
of
these
measures
do
not
have
the
desired
effect
and
protests
are
held
on
a
large
scale
with
the
blockade
of
administrative
buildings
,
then
security
forces
could
receive
the
order
to
disperse
protests
and
arrest
their
leaders
.
Detachments
of
the
<[>National
Guard<]>
,
<[>Armed
Forces<]>
,
and
<[>SBU<]>
special
forces
have
been
proposed
to
carry
out
such
operations
.
At
the
headquarters
meeting
,
the
<[>National
Security
and
Defense
Committee
of
Ukraine<]>
was
instructed
to
prepare
draft
legislation
on
the
imposition
of
martial
law
and
a
curfew
in
Kiev
,
sources
have
reported
.
The
most
likely
pretext
for
protests
will
be
the
so
-
called
“shock
bills”
,
according
to
which
as
of
October
new
prices
are
to
be
introduced
for
heating
.
Earlier
,
the
Cabinet
of
Ministers
raised
them
by
75
-
90
%
.
Now
,
heating
a
two
-
bedroom
apartment
costs
approximately
1
,
500
hryvnia
,
while
the
average
salary
is
in
the
range
of
only
5
,
000
hryvnia
.
Earlier
,
authorities
also
raised
the
prices
for
electricity
,
gas
,
and
cold
water
.
Videos
taken
by
locals
have
captured
columns
of
military
vehicles

Yulia
Tymoshenko
has
urged
Ukrainians
to
take
to
the
streets
on
November
15th
for
an
indefinite
protest
action
in
the
center
of
Kiev
.
She
stated
this
on
Monday
,
November
14th
,
during
a
speech
in
the
Verkhovna
Rada
.
According
to
Tymoshenko
,
Ukrainian
President
Petro
Poroshenko
and
the
National
Bank
have
become
a
bastion
of
corruption
and
the
head
of
state
has
appointed
his
business
partners
to
key
positions
in
the
country
.
“Today
only
the
people
can
restore
justice
and
put
the
government
in
its
place
.
Tomorrow
morning
,
citizens
,
including
pensioners
,
will
go
out
for
an
indefinite
protest
against
the
devaluation
of
the
hryvnia
,
the
increase
in
utility
costs
,
and
for
returning
their
bank
deposits
,
”
she
announced
.
Tymoshenko
also
added
that
the
government
is
calling
protesters
“the
hand
of
the
Kremlin”
,
while
in
fact
“people
are
just
fed
up
.
”
“Officials
hide
behind
the
war
,
but
they
themselves
are
corrupting
and
robbing
the
country
.
Either
the
people
will
unite
or
the
government
will
simply
destroy
the
Ukrainian
nation
and
Ukrainian
state
,
”
she
emphasized
.
Information
that
Tymoshenko
was
preparing
a
new
Maidan
appeared
as
early
as
late
September
.
It
was
reported
that
public
organizations
with
links
to
her
had
purchased
from
300
to
500
tents
for
use
in
mass
actions
.
Tymoshenko
recently
stated
that
even
Western
Ukraine
is
starting
to
think
positively
about
the
country’s
former
president
,
Viktor
Yanukovych
.
“If
they
think
so
in
Galicia
,
then
you
can
only
imagine
what
thoughts
people
from
other
regions
are
having
,
"
she
warned
.
