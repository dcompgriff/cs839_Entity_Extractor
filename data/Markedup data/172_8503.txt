John
P

Warren
–
Can
anyone
doubt
Donald
J
.
Trump
may
well
become
our
first
Independent
POTUS
?
Conservatives
disdain
him
and
all
that
he
stands
for
,
and
Progressives
of
all
stripes
deplore
him
and
the
basket
of
his
supporters
.
The
establishment
disavows
him
.
So
who
will
elect
him
?
·
The
<[>Blue
Dog
Coalition<]>
—
represents
conservative
Democrats
who
have
tired
of
identity
politics
,
empty
promises
to
working
people
,
destruction
of
their
mores
,
and
the
rampant
corruption
amongst
top
Dems
.
·
Mainstream
Republicans
—
are
all
over
the
map
in
their
beliefs
about
religion
,
sexual
identity
,
abortion
,
gun
rights
,
and
immigration
,
but
they
are
fed
up
with
the
take
-
no
-
prisoners
approach
by
extremists
in
their
party
.
Despite
putdowns
to
the
contrary
,
they
cross
social
,
wealth
,
and
educational
boundaries
.
·
Indies
—
comprise
the
big
chunk
smack
in
the
middle
who
,
like
ordinary
Republicans
,
eschew
the
extreme
positions
,
are
willing
to
compromise
,
even
on
sensitive
and
personal
issues
,
but
want
something
done
about
immigration
and
the
gaps
in
job
opportunities
,
education
,
and
wealth
.
Indies
hate
corruption
more
than
bad
social
behavior
.

These
groups
are
angry
about
the
banana
republic
culture
of
progressive
Democrats
.
They
know
that
for
all
his
personal
foibles
,
Donald
Trump
is
right
:
the
system
is
rigged
against
an
outlier
.
That’s
not
to
suggest
there’s
a
group
of
elites
arranging
things
to
their
liking
with
a
few
string
-
pulls
.

It’s
the
system
of
two
major
party
establishments
encrusted
with
the
principles
of
their
in
-
house
philosophical
tyrants
.
It’s
a
society
in
which
progressives
infest
our
educational
system
,
Hollywood
and
the
entertainment
industry
,
and
the
grossly
mis
-
named
mainstream
media
crowd
.
It’s
a
federal
government
no
longer
a
traffic
cop
protecting
our
rights
,
but
rather
,
but
another
tool
corrupted
for
the
progressive
political
agenda
.
Trump’s
constituencies
know
that
anyone
running
outside
permitted
boundaries
has
had
no
chance
of
success
.

Until
now
.
Until
Donald
J
.
Trump
.
He’s
the
outlier
.
The
underdog
tired
of
being
kicked
around
.
Despite
myriad
splinters
this
particular
example
of
presidential
timber
,
Trump
has
beat
all
the
odds
,
and
from
this
vantage
point
of
over
a
week
out
,
November
8
looks
to
be
more
than
a
squeaker
in
his
favor
.

Unless
,
of
course
,
the
election
itself
is
stolen
by
Democrats
so
desperate
to
keep
hidden
their
secrets
.
Is
it
possible
to
commit
vote
fraud
?
Most
definitely
.
It’s
not
about
people
registered
in
both
Ohio
and
Florida
,
whole
cemeteries
or
ex
-
residents
of
state
pens
going
to
the
polls
.
That
has
happened
and
will
happen
again
,
but
unless
there’s
a
massive
number
of
people
moving
a
massive
amount
of
votes
in
exactly
the
right
locales
,
the
national
election
should
remain
relatively
immune
from
such
shenanigans
.

Also
,
defective
voting
machines
have
always
been
with
us
,
so
it’s
up
to
each
citizen
to
pay
close
attention
to
what
happens
before
pulling
the
lever
.
What
they
can’t
see
,
however
,
is
the
invisible
third
party
electronically
camped
between
county
election
offices
and
their
respective
state
capitols
flipping
votes
a
few
thousand
here
and
there
.
If
THAT
happens
,
we
will
not
keep
the
republic
Ben
Franklin
and
the
Founders
gave
us
.
For
this
discussion
,
however
,
let’s
hope
that’s
not
the
case
.

If
Hillary
Clinton
is
“
elected
,
”
her
administration
will
be
dogged
by
journalistic
and
other
investigators
digging
deeper
into
the
pile
of
political
offal
that
represents
the
mass
of
Clinton
pay
-
to
-
play
activities
.
And
if
the
<[>FBI<]>
“
gets
religion
”
this
time
around
,
that
cancer
will
not
be
curable
.

If
Trump
,
surviving
every
barrage
,
pushes
through
to
electoral
victory
,
November
8
th
is
one
hurdle
,
but
there
remain
others
before
Inauguration
Day
.
If
possible—despite
Hillary’s
oh
-
so
-
pious
promises
to
the
contrary—progressives
will
challenge
the
vote
everywhere
they
can
.
Assuming
those
challenges
come
to
naught
,
the
next
hurdle
is
the
vote
by
the
<[>Electoral
College<]>
itself
.

Currently
,
there
are
538
electors
(
for
435
representatives
,
100
senators
,
and
three
allotted
to
Washington
,
DC
)
.
Except
for
Maine
and
Nebraska
,
which
awards
its
electoral
votes
by
congressional
district
,
the
other
forty
-
eight
are
winner
-
take
-
all
.
Electors
are
usually
chosen
by
each
political
party
,
and
most
often
,
they
are
true
to
the
pledge
they
have
given
.

Yet
,
in
this
year
of
all
years
,
when
Trump
is
not
a
Republican’s
Republican
,
and
Democrats
will
not
be
shy
about
dirty
tricks
,
it’s
the
issue
of
faithfulness
that
matters
.
Only
24
states
have
laws
to
punish
faithless
electors—those
who
cast
a
vote
for
other
than
the
person
to
whom
they
are
pledged
,
so
the
potential
for
faithless
electors
in
the
other
26
states
and
DC
is
greater
than
ever
before
.

Faithless
electors
aside
,
they
will
meet
in
their
respective
state
capitals
on
the
Monday
after
the
second
Wednesday
in
December—this
year
,
December
19
th
,
and
ordinarily
,
the
process
should
be
little
more
than
a
formality
required
by
the
Constitution
.

Then
,
there’s
the
Twelfth
Amendment
requiring
<[>Congress<]>
to
convene
in
joint
session
on
January
6
,
2017
.
There
,
the
newly
installed
House
of
Representatives
declares
the
winner
of
the
election
.
The
kicker
is
that
if
one
member
of
each
house
,
in
writing
,
objects
to
the
vote
count
of
a
state
,
the
entire
assemblage
,
after
separate
debate
in
their
respective
chambers
,
decides
whether
to
accept
or
reject
the
objection
.
It’s
easy
to
imagine
,
how
in
this
particular
election
,
the
process
might
be
manipulated
by
a
Bernie
Sanders
or
an
Elizabeth
Warren
.

Trump’s
last
hurdle
will
be
to
disabuse
the
fears
of
many
Americans
so
heavily
stoked
by
those
arrayed
against
him
,
and
then
bring
together
all
but
die
-
hard
progressives
in
rebuilding
America
as
the
last
best
hope
of
humanity
on
this
planet
.
It’s
a
daunting
task
,
but
Donald
Trump
is
the
only
candidate
with
the
political
cojones
to
get
it
done
.

So
,
let’s
get
‘
er
done
!
