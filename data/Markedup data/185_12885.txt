After
months
of
similar
struggle
to
protect
sacred
burial
grounds
and
the
Missouri
river
,
opposers
of
the
DAPL
were
blessed
today
when
a
herd
of
buffalo
appeared
from
nowhere
.
While
mass
arrests
,
macing
,
and
beatings
from
batons
took
place
,
a
stampede
of
bison
appeared
near
the
Standing
Rock
protest
camp
.
Reportedly
,
a
cry
of
joy
erupted
from
the
crowd
,
as
protectors
have
been
praying
for
help
from
the
American
bison
(
known
as
Tatanka
Oyate
)
during
their
standoff
with
riot
police
and
national
guardsmen
.

As

relays
,
the
Native
American
culture
honors
the
Tatanka
Oyate
as
a
symbol
of
sacrifice
.
Its
appearance
is
reportedly
being
hailed
as
a
gift
from
the
Great
Spirit
.

Buffalo
are
revered
as
symbols
of
sacrifice
in
Native
American
culture
.
Indigenous
people
believe
the
American
bison
,
which
are
also
known
as
“Tatanka
Oyate”
or
“Buffalo
Nation
,
”
sacrifice
themselves
in
order
to
supply
their
meat
and
their
hides
for
people
.
