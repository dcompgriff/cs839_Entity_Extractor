Big
Cannabis
–
on
the
lines
of
Big
Pharma
–
is
on
the
cards
.
At
least
that’s
what
Germany
-
based
pharmaceutical
giant
Bayer’s
$
66
billion
takeover
of
America
-
based
agrichemical
giant
Monsanto
(
a
leading
producer
of
RoundUp
Ready
genetically
modified
crops
)
indicates
.
Financed
from
a
consortium
of
corrupt
,
in

debt
,
and
influential
banks
(
including
Goldman
Sachs
,
HSBC
,
JP
Morgan
,
and
Bank
of
America
)
,
the
multi
-
billion
-
dollar
deal
(
negotiated
by
the
Rothschild
Banking
Cartel
)
brings
Bayer
(
famous
for
selling
heroin
to
children
and
financing
Nazi
concentration
camps
)
closer
to
the
multi
-
billion
-

cannabis
market
through
its
”mission”
to
create
a
one

for

crop

and
computer

will
make

making

Cannabis
proponents
believe
the
largest
all
-
cash
deal
on
record
will
destroy
the
infant
marijuana
industry
by
introducing
genetically
modified
cannabis
seeds
,
highly
expensive
cannabis
-
based
drugs
,
monopolistic
use
of
patents
,
and
restrictive
business
practices
.
Leafly
notes:
“The
worry
is
that
the
combined
firm
will
have
the
financial
and
political
influence
to
do
to
cannabis
what
it
has
already
done
to
corn
,
tobacco
,
and
other
cash
crops
—
namely
,
use
pricey
patented
cannabis
seeds
(
Roundup
Ready
Blue
Dream
,
anyone
?
)
that
favor
large
-
scale
operators
and
rigidly
control
how
all
cannabis
farmers
farm
.
The
merger
,
in
other
words
,
could
be
the
first
step
toward
Big
Cannabis
.
”
Monsanto’s
decades
old
intimate
ties
with
the
Scotts
Miracle
-
Gro
Company
—
a
leading
producer
of
pesticides
for
commercial
and
consumer
lawn
and
garden
use
(
who
was
ordered
to
pay
$
12
.
5
million
in
criminal
fines
and
civil
penalties
for
violations
of
Federal
Pesticide
Laws
in
2012
)
—
is
especially
a
matter
of
concern
.
Monsanto
and
Scotts
Miracle
-
Gro
have
long
been
partners
with
the
DEA
to
produce
hormones
and
carcinogenic
chemicals
used
in
the
wars
against
marijuana
and
coca
plants
.
Jim
Hagedorn
,
who
took
over
Scotts
Miracle
-
Gro
in
2001
,
shared
his
intention
to
“invest
,
like
,
half
a
billion
in
the
pot
business”
with
Forbes
in
July
,
calling
cannabis
the
biggest
thing
he
has
ever
seen
in
lawn
and
garden
.
Forbes
reports:
Scotts
Miracle
-
Gro
shelled
out
$
135
million
last
year
on
two
California
-
based
businesses
[
including
the
$
130
million
buyout
of
General
Hydroponics
]
that
sell
fertilizers
,
soils
and
accessories
to
pot
growers
.
It
recently
spent
another
$
120
million
on
a
still
-
undisclosed
lighting
and
hydroponics
equipment
company
in
Amsterdam
and
promises
to
invest
about
another
$
150
million
by
the
end
of
2016
.
Altogether
,
the
deals
are
bigger
than
the
largest
single
acquisition
in
the
history
of
Scotts
Miracle
-
Gro
,
which
takes
in
$
160
million
of
profit
on
$
3
billion
in
sales
annually
.
