EVERYTHING
is
now
gentrification,
including
attempts
to
stop
gentrification.
Hairdresser
Helen
Archer
was
accused
of
abetting
the
gentrification
of
her
community
when
she
tried
to
protest
plans
to
turn
a
derelict
pub
into
boutique
flats
for
awful
people.
Archer,
of
Hackney
Citizens
Against
Gentrification,
said:
“Apparently,
residents’
associations
are
very
trendy
these
days,
and
using
direct
action
to
confront
property
developers
might
lead
to
us
being
mistaken
for
a
collective
of
Japanese
fashion
photographers.
“Leafleting
nearby
streets
is
gentrification,
writing
to
the
council
is
definitely
gentrification,
and
starting
a
blog
about
the
destruction
of
local
history
is
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
a
tosser
in
a
corduroy
waistcoat
would
do.”
Professor
Henry
Brubaker,
of
the
Institute
of
Studies,
said:
“Once
the
gentrification
of
a
deprived
area
has
begun,
everything
that
happens
there
is
evidence
of
its
transformation
into
a
pretentious
haven
for
entitled
bastards.
“The
pop-up
cycle
boutiques
and
organic
juice
salons
are
coming.
They
will
come
if
you
accept
gentrification.
They
will
come
if
you
fight
gentrification.
Nothing
can
stop
them.
“Talking
about
gentrification
is
also
gentrification,
and
so
is
reading
about
it,
so
this
one’s
on
you
too.”
