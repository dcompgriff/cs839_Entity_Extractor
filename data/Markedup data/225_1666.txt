In
2001,
historian
Roger
Ekirch
of
Virginia
Tech
published
a
paper
that
included
over
15
years
of
research.
It
cited
an
overwhelming
amount
of
historical
evidence
which
reveals
that
humans
used
to
in
fact
sleep
in
two
different
chunks.

In
2005,
he
published
a
book
titled
“At
Day’s
Close:
Night
in
Times
Past,”
which
included
more
than
500
references
to
a
disjointed
sleeping
pattern.
It
included
diaries,
medical
books,
literature
and
more
taken
from
various
sources
ranging
from
Homer’s
Odyssey
all
the
way
to
modern
tribes
in
Nigeria.
“It’s
not
just
the
number
of
references
–
it
is
the
way
they
refer
to
it,
as
if
it
was
common
knowledge.”–

What
Was
Found
In
The
Research
Ekirch’s
research
found
that
we
didn’t
always
sleep
for
an
average
of
8
hours
straight.
Instead,
we
would
sleep
in
two
shorter
periods
throughout
the
night.
All
sleep
would
occur
within
a
12
hour
time
frame
that
started
with
3
or
4
hours
of
sleep,
followed
by
being
awake
for
3
hours
or
so,
and
then
sleeping
again
until
the
morning.
There
was
also
some
research
done
in
the
early
1990’s
by
psychiatrist
Thomas
Wehr.
He
conducted
an
experiment
where
14
people
were
put
into
complete
darkness
for
14
hours
a
day
for
an
entire
month.
By
the
fourth
week
the
participants
had
settled
into
a
very
distinct
sleeping
pattern:
the
same
bimodal
sleeping
pattern
that
Ekirch
described.
The
subjects
slept
for
approximately
4
hours,
woke
for
another
few,
and
then
went
back
to
sleep
until
morning.

“Ekirch
found
that
references
to
the
first
and
second
sleep
started
to
disappear
during
the
late
17th
Century.
This
started
among
the
urban
upper
classes
in
northern
Europe
and
over
the
course
of
the
next
200
years
filtered
down
to
the
rest
of
Western
society.
By
the
1920’s
the
idea
of
a
first
and
second
sleep
had
receded
entirely
from
our
social
consciousness.”

Possible
Reasons
As
To
Why
It
Was
Like
This
One
reason
could
be
that
this
type
of
segmented
sleep
is
what
really
comes
naturally
to
the
human
body.
At
least,
that’s
what
Wehr’s
experiment
would
suggest,
but
there
are
other
theories.

Historian
Craig
Koslofsky
writes:
“Associations
with
night
before
the
17th
Century
were
not
good.
The
night
was
a
place
populated
by
people
of
disrepute
–
criminals,
prostitutes
and
drunks.
Even
the
wealthy,
who
could
afford
candlelight,
had
better
things
to
spend
their
money
on.
There
was
no
prestige
or
social
value
associated
with
staying
up
all
night.”

Things
changed,
however,
in
1667
when
Paris
became
the
first
city
in
the
world
to
light
its
streets,
and
eventually
throughout
Europe
staying
up
at
night
became
the
social
norm.
And
then
the
industrial
revolution
happened:
“People
were
becoming
increasingly
time-conscious
and
sensitive
to
efficiency,
certainly
before
the
19th
Century,
but
the
industrial
revolution
intensified
that
attitude
by
leaps
and
bounds.”

Eventually,
we
got
to
the
point
where
parents
were
forcing
their
children
to
sleep
at
a
certain
time,
pushing
them
away
from
the
segmented
sleeping
pattern
that
was
more
dominant.
Many
Sleeping
Problems
May
Have
Roots
In
The
Human
Body’s
Natural
Preference
For
Segmented
Sleep
Ekirch
believes
that
many
modern
day
sleeping
problems
have
roots
in
the
human
body’s
natural
preference
for
segmented
sleep.
He
believes
that
our
historical
sleeping
patterns
could
be
the
reason
why
many
people
suffer
from
a
condition
called
“sleep
maintenance
insomnia,”
where
individuals
wake
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
have
trouble
getting
back
to
sleep.
This
type
of
condition
first
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
19th
century,
at
approximately
the
same
time
segmented
sleep
began
to
die
off.
“
For
most
of
evolution
we
slept
a
certain
way.
Waking
up
during
the
night
is
part
of
normal
human
physiology
.
The
idea
that
we
must
sleep
in
a
consolidated
block
could
be
damaging,
he
says,
if
it
makes
people
who
wake
up
at
night
anxious,
as
this
anxiety
can
itself
prohibit
sleep
and
is
likely
to
seep
into
waking
life
too.

Psychologist
Greg
Jacobs
(

According
to
Russell
Foster,
a
professor
of
circadian
[body
clock]
neuroscience
at
Oxford:
“
Many
people
wake
up
at
night
and
panic.
I
tell
them
that
what
they
are
experiencing
is
a
throwback
to
the
bi-modal
sleep
pattern.
But
the
majority
of
doctors
still
fail
to
acknowledge
that
a
consolidated
eight-hour
sleep
may
be
unnatural.
Over
30%
of
the
medical
problems
that
doctors
are
faced
with
stem
directly
or
indirectly
from
sleep.
But
sleep
has
been
ignored
in
medical
training
and
there
are
very
few
centers
where
sleep
is
studied
.”

As
far
as
what
people
did
during
this
in-between
time
of
wakefulness,
Ekirch’s
research
suggests
that
they
primarily
used
the
time
to
meditate
on
their
dreams,
read,
pray,
or
partake
in
spiritual
practices.
