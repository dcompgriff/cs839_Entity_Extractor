The
deliberations
of
the
Constitutional
Convention
of
1787
were
held
in
strict
secrecy.
Citizens
gathered
outside
Independence
Hall
in
Philadelphia
during
the
proceedings,
attempting
to
learn
what
sort
of
government
had
been
agreed
upon
behind
closed
doors.
As
he
exited
the
Hall,
a
woman
asked
Benjamin
Franklin,
“Well,
Doctor,
what
have
we
got
a
republic
or
a
monarchy?”

Franklin
responded,
“A
republic,
if
you
can
keep
it.”

It’s
important
to
note
that
Franklin
did
not
include
the
word
democracy
because
the
difference
between
a
republic
and
a
democracy
is
fundamental.
The
word
republic
comes
from
the
Romans’
word
in
Latin
res
publica
—
which
means
“the
public
thing.”
“Democracy,”
on
the
other
hand,
invented
by
the
Greeks,
comes
from
their
words
demos
and
kratein
,
which
means
“the
peoples’
rule.”
Greek
democracy
meant
majority
rule.
Yet,
even
during
its
first
few
decades
of
existence,
the
great
Greek
thinkers
such
as
Plato
and
Aristotle
rejected
democracy
as
a
bad
form
of
governance,
labeling
it
“mob
rule.”

So
we
can
confer
on
Franklin’s
response
to
that
inquiring
woman
that
he
believed,
in
the
wake
of
Britain’s
capitulation
to
Washington’s
revolutionary
army,
the
Continental
Congress
had
created
a
constitutional
republic
fashioned
much
more
closely
to
the
Roman
representative
Republic
than
the
Athenian
Democracy.

But
now,
230
years
later,
we
must
countenance
the
specter
of
a
woman
who
has
trafficked
in
national
security
secrets
and
is
guilty
of
numerous
felonies
becoming
the
president
of
the
United
States.
This
has
made
me
wondering
if
it
might
not
be
possible
for
the
House
of
Representatives
to
begin
impeachment
proceedings
against
a
President
Clinton
shortly
after
her
election.
So
I
resolved
to
contact
various
members
of
Congress
to
ask
them
if
they
wouldn’t
attempt
impeachment
as
a
means
to
fulfill
their
oaths
of
office
to
preserve
and
protect
the
constitution.

I
first
made
contact
with
Congressman
Tom
McClintock
of
the
4
th
District
of
Northern
California.
What
follows
is
our
interview:

Kelley:
Do
you
agree
with
my
contention
that
a
Hillary
presidency
would
mean
that
we
would
be
a
post
constitutional
republic?

McClintock:
I’m
afraid
we
may
already
have
entered
the
post-constitutional
phase
of
American
history.
The
fundamental
architecture
of
the
American
Republic
–
the
separation
of
powers
and
the
Bill
of
Rights
–
is
already
breaking
down.
The
question
now
is
whether
we
will
enter
the
restoration
period
or
the
decline
period
of
our
free
government.
I
think
a
Hillary
Clinton
presidency
has
the
potential
of
taking
us
past
a
tipping
point
that
makes
restoration
of
the
Constitution
much
more
difficult
and
unlikely.

K:
What
do
you
think
the
ramifications
of
her
election
would
be?

If
the
current
justices
all
serve
until
their
actuarial
age,
the
next
President
will
make
four
appointments
to
the
Supreme
Court.
Clinton
and
Justice
Ginsburg
have
made
it
very
clear
that
once
a
lock-step
leftist
majority
is
cemented
into
that
court,
their
first
two
objectives
are
reversing
Citizens
United
and
Heller,
which
would
have
dire
implications
to
our
First
and
Second
Amendment
rights.
I
would
expect
that
due
process
protections
will
begin
falling
quickly
thereafter
to
enable,
among
other
things,
the
prosecution
of
dissenters
from
leftist
global
warming
orthodoxy.
And
even
if
the
election
of
2020
produced
a
Republican
president
with
overwhelming
Republican
congressional
majorities,
any
serious
reform
legislation
could
be
expected
to
be
struck
down
by
a
court
whose
majority
will
view
its
role
as
policy-making
rather
than
upholding
the
Constitution.
I
could
add
the
catastrophic
impact
of
her
“open
borders”
program
that
has
devastated
Europe
and
her
intention
to
further
increase
taxes
and
regulatory
burdens
that
could
deal
a
knock-out
blow
to
our
faltering
economy.

K:
What
do
you
think
the
likelihood
would
be
of
her
immediate
impeachment?

M:
Zero.
Impeachment
requires
2/3
of
the
Senate,
which
would
be
a
political
impossibility.

K:
If
it
cannot
remove
a
known
felonious
president
who,
as
Secretary
of
State,
compromised
national
security,
has
Congress
lost
its
power
to
be
a
check
on
the
executive
branch?

M:
The
Constitution
was
written
to
be
self-enforcing.
But
that
only
works
as
long
as
its
powers
are
evenly
divided;
which,
in
turn,
only
works
if
the
officials
who
exercise
its
powers
are
obedient
to
that
Constitution;
which,
in
turn,
only
works
if
“we,
the
people,”
through
our
votes,
insist
on
it.
When
we
stop
insisting
on
it,
we
forfeit
our
Constitution
and
the
freedoms
it
protects.
Lincoln
was
right:
“If
destruction
be
our
lot,
we
must,
ourselves
be
its
author
and
finisher.
As
a
nation
of
free
men,
we
are
destined
to
live
for
all
time,
or
die
by
suicide.”

K:
But
even
if
there
were
no
chance
she
could
be
removed,
wouldn’t
simply
the
filing
of
impeachment
articles
be
a
historic
way
for
those
who
wish
to
remain
obedient
to
the
Constitution
to
voice
a
powerful
rejection
of
her
lawlessness?

M:
Larry,
you’re
dreaming.
There’s
no
do-over
for
this
election.
(End
of
Interview).

As
a
nation,
we’ve
had
a
pretty
good
two-hundred-year
run.
But
as
Ben
Franklin
warned
and
Congressman
McClintock
fears,
we
may
now
have
not
kept
or
constitutional
republic.
