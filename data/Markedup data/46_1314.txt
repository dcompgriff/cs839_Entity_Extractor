In
a
decade
on
the
House
Financial
Services
Committee
Keith
Ellison
hasn’t
targeted
the
credit
card
racketeers,
or
the
banksters
who
flooded
the
market
with
predatory
home
and
student
loans
or
federal
officials
who
refuse
to
relieve
underwater
homeowners.
Democratic
party
leaders
need
another
empty
black
face
to
front
the
DNC,
someone
who
blames
Wikileaks
and
the
Russians
for
Hillary’s
defeat.
Ellison
will
do
just
fine.

In
the
wake
of
Donald
Trump’s
election,
Democratic
party
honchos
are
scrambling
to
reassure
their
funders
and
to
shore
up
the
careers
of
Democratic
elected
officials
who
serve
those
funders.
They
must
justify
and
retain
whatever
hold
they
still
have
on
the
millions
of
nominal
Democratic
voters
who
actually
have
no
voice
whatsoever
in
what
their
party
stands
for.

At
bottom,
the
two
capitalist
parties
are
owned
by
the
same
class
of
elite
one
percenter
funders
but
with
different
voting
bases
At
least
one
US
party
is
always
the
self-declared
White
Man’s
Party.
Since
the
late
sixties
Republicans
have
reserved
that
slot
for
themselves,
leaving
Democrats
to
claim
the
allegiance
of
racial
minorities
and
some
other
groups.
The
different
voting
bases
of
the
two
parties
mean
they
have
different
campaign
styles,
but
when
the
campaigns
are
over
they’re
both
as
Barack
Obama
affirmed,
on
the
same
team.
Both
parties
deliver
the
mandate
of
their
constituencies
to
their
common
funders,
Big
Ag,
Big
Oil,
Big
Insurance,
Big
Pharma,
Big
Real
Estate,
the
military
contractors
and
Wall
Street.

After
the
departures
of
Debbie
Wasserman-Schulz
and
Donna
Brazile,
both
deeply
implicated
in
the
sabotaging
of
Bernie
Sanders
and
Hillary
Clinton’s
loss,
Democrats
need
a
new
face
at
the
head
of
the
Democratic
National
Committee,
the
national
party’s
executive
body.
Ideally
it
should
be
someone
who
reassures
the
funders
and
can
help
rally
the
base
voters.
The
leading
contender
is
Keith
Ellison,
just
elected
to
his
sixth
term
in
Congress
from
Minneapolis.

Keith
Ellison
seems
a
good
fit.
He
was
the
first
Muslim
ever
elected
to
Congress,
a
member
of
the
Congressional
Black
Caucus
and
current
co-chair
of
the
large
and
virtually
impotent
House
Progressive
Caucus.
He
was
an
early
endorser
of
Bernie
Sanders
who
did
his
duty
trying
to
lead
leftward
strays
back
into
Hillary’s
big
tent
.
In
a
decade
on
the
House
Financial
Services
Committee,
Ellison
managed
not
to
deeply
offend
the
banksters
who
flooded
the
market
with
predatory
housing
and
student
loans,
or
the
payday
lenders
and
credit
card
racketeers,
and
he
didn’t
embarrass
or
insult
the
colleagues
who
openly
shill
for
them.
In
that
target
rich
environment
Ellison
managed
not
just
to
keep
from
hitting
anything,
but
not
even
to
take
aim.

By
contrast,
Senator
Elizabeth
Warren
in
2014
made
headlines
when
she
grilled
Ellison's
former
Congressional
Black
Caucus
colleague
Mel
Watt
,
on
why
the
agency
he
heads,
despite
a
clear
mandate
from
Congress
to
reduce
the
principals
on
potentially
millions
of
unpayable
predatory
home
loans,
refused
to
reduce
the
principal
on
a
single
one.
Three
years
later
the
news
is
that
the
agency
may
reduce
principal
on
a
mere
3,100
home
loans
at
most
.
We’re
still
waiting
to
hear
from
Ellison
and
the
other
eight
black
Democrats
on
the
committee
on
this
failure.

But
Ellison
is
black.
He’s
the
first
Muslim
elected
to
Congress,
he’s
smart
enough
and
telegenic.
He
votes
infallibly
to
support
the
apartheid
regime
in
Israel,
and
he
says
if
it
were
up
to
him
there’d
have
been
a
no-fly
zone
(and
possible
shooting
war
with
the
Russians)
a
long
time
ago.

Hillary’s
indispensable
firewall
was
supposed
to
be
the
black
vote,
for
which
she
needed
to
do
little
else
than
mumble
about
“black
lives
mattering”
and
pose
occasionally
with
the
mothers
of
some
of
those
murdered
by
police.
Democratic
shot
callers
seem
to
still
believe
that
all
they
need
is
another
empty
black
face
in
a
high
place.
They
won’t
get
another
First
Black
President.
It
was
Hillary’s
turn
and
that
didn’t
work
out.
Now
it’s
Keith
Ellison’s
another
empty
black
face
in
a
very
high
place.
