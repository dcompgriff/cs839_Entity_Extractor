For
many
years,
I’ve
seen
more
and
more
of
my
rural
and
tribal
neighbors
pack
their
children
off
to
school.
Now,
every
morning
between
8:00
and
9:00
am
in
this
upwardly-mobile-yet-backward
district,
the
country
roads
are
full
of
children
commuting
to
school,
hoisting
bags
laden
with
what
they
believe
is
the
wisdom
and
knowhow
of
modern
culture.
They
are
going
for
vidyabhyaasam
(education,
or
more
literally
speaking,
‘the
exercise
of
knowledge’),
and
they
go
to
the
keepers
of
this
knowledge
–
to
teachers
in
schools.
Everyone
(parents,
children,
the
state
and
society)
deems
this
to
be
good
and
necessary.

While
I’ve
long
been
a
champion
of
equal
opportunities,
I’m
now
starting
to
believe
that
a
dark
and
dangerous
psychic
predicament
is
falling
upon
this
land,
in
part
aided
by
the
simultaneous
entry
of
television
into
village
homes,
and
a
slew
of
fickle
government
policies
aimed
at
progress,
modernity
and
the
end
of
poverty.

The
result
is
that
self-reliance
and
land-based
sustenance
have
been,
more
or
less,
replaced
by
a
mobile
populace
commuting
daily
in
the
hope
of
finding
skills,
knowledge,
support,
wisdom
and
security
elsewhere.
A
perverse
notion
–
that
the
‘other
is
better’
than
self
and
home,
that
this
‘other’
can
be
acquired
through
hard
work,
enterprise,
subsidies
and
bank
loans,
that
everyone
is
now
entitled
to
this
‘other’–
is
now
here
in
our
midst.

Since
mental
and
social
strife
are
also
increasing,
perhaps
this
version
of
modernity,
underneath
all
the
glitter
and
promise,
needs
some
examination.
Is
it
for
instance,
instilling
aspirations
that
can
never
be
truly
fulfilled?
Is
it
exchanging
one
type
of
poverty
for
another?
What
happens
to
family
and
community
relations
once
the
young
leave?
What
do
these
children
do,
once
schooled?

The
subsidiary
thesis
of
this
essay
is
that
modern
education
serves
a
version
of
Gulag,
by
forcing
our
young
to
suffer
unspeakable
conditions
at
an
early
age,
by
compelling
them
to
do
school
work
and
homework
for
a
greater
part
of
their
day.
By
sustaining
this
over
long
periods,
at
the
most
crucial
time
in
their
vulnerable
years,
it
breaks
them,
in
order
to
refashion
them
into
a
pliable
workforce.
By
the
end
of
schooling,
if
they
succeed,
the
young
are
yoked,
through
fear
and
the
promise
of
salvation.
(If
they
fail,
as
indeed
most
do,
they
are
consigned
to
lesser
destinies).
This
arduous
entrainment
is
essential
for
the
great
global
workplace,
and
can
only
happen
with
various
forms
of
rewards,
promises,
threats,
violence
and
incarceration.

Incarceration
(both
voluntary
and
involuntary),
when
sustained
and
normalized,
leads
to
a
range
of
issues—shutdown,
frustration,
disorder,
escape,
split
psychologies,
helplessness,
dissociation,
physical
ailments
and
phobias.
These
can
be
seen
amongst
children,
prisoners,
slaves,
caged
and
beaten
animals,
controlled
peoples.

The
primary
thesis
of
this
essay
is
that
the
psychic
predicament
just
outlined
goes
hand
in
hand
with
the
destruction
of
life,
with
the
catastrophic
end
of
the
biosphere.

A
DIY
manual
for
colonizing
a
new
land
might
read:

•
First
persuade,
seduce,
bribe
or
devastate
the
people.
Break
up
their
society,
their
beliefs,
and
their
ways
of
life.•
Take
over
their
rivers,
and
their
forests.
Do
this
by
hook
or
crook.
Or
use
plain
force,
no
pretense.•
Convince
them
that
it’s
for
their
own
good.
Even
better,
work
on
the
young.
Instill
the
idea
that
you
have
something
supremely
better
to
offer.•
Draw
them
into
the
concrete
jungle,
into
the
cyber
machine,
into
the
factorial
workplace,
into
the
idea
of
the
good
life
in
the
shining
city.•
At
all
times
control
their
food
and
water:
this
instills
fear
and
compliance.•
Then,
sever
their
allegiance
to
their
bodies
and
psyches;
hook
them
to
the
machine.•
Be
the
mighty
provider.

Evicted
populations,
trans-located
communities,
weakened
land-based
cultures,
and
migrant
workforces
need
to
be
fed,
watered,
educated,
employed,
housed
and
kept
docile
with
entertainment.
You
have
them
when
you’ve
sold
them
the
idea
of
choice
while
you’ve
closed
all
the
exit
points,
and
they
eat
what
you
supply.
Enter
a
new
species
of
human
bred
on
petroleum-driven
food,
petroleum-driven
water,
petroleum-driven
health,
petroleum-driven
culture,
petroleum-driven
mind.

Little
bodies
I’ve
known,
bodies
tumbling,
climbing,
swimming,
running,
now
sit
still
for
long
hours,
with
book/notebook/pencil
in
hand,
in
thrall,
if
not
of
the
authority
at
the
far
end
of
the
classroom,
then
of
their
fantasies.
Little
minds
I’ve
known,
curious,
aware,
sensitive,
attuned
to
the
lives
of
creatures,
rivers,
land
and
each
other
thrown
into
the
maw
of
the
global
machine,
to
be
carried
away
to
faraway
lands
and
cities.

The
young
are
given
thoughts,
ideas
and
behaviors
to
follow
or
imitate,
and
to
believe
without
question,
to
accept
without
dispute,
and
to
ignore
the
call
of
their
own
bodies.
By
the
end
of
schooling
students
take
the
following
to
be
truths:
everything
comes
with
a
price
tag;
it’s
possible
to
have
an
economy
without
an
ecology;
the
earth
is
irrelevant;
other
humans
are
irrelevant;
life
is
a
matter
of
goods,
gadgets,
cash
transactions
and
services.

It’s
a
rare
community
that
does
not
send
its
children
away
to
the
cold
vigilant
‘care’
of
ever-distant
adults
of
varying
backgrounds
and
temperaments,
teaching
ever-distant
things,
for
the
sake
of
progress
and
human
betterment.
This
sending
away,
experienced
by
children
variously
as
severance,
uprooting
or
exile,
is
done
with
good
intention,
and
full
conviction.

The
Left,
the
fringe,
the
rebels
and
the
spiritually-minded
have
clearly
outlined
how
schools
breed
factory
workers,
zombies
and
psychopaths.
I’d
like
to
propose
that
schooling
is
necessary
for
building
a
hierarchy
of
egos
by
destroying
the
individual’s
inherence
in
community
through
an
insidiously
brutal
system
of
reward
and
punishment
normalized
in
the
name
of
education
and
social
advancement.
This
hierarchy
of
egos,
with
an
elite
at
the
top
commanding
much
of
the
world’s
wealth
and
people,
is
essential
to
genocide
and
ecocide.

Today,
I’m
on
a
journey
with
a
friend
of
mine,
a
Kurchiya
tribesman.
We’ve
just
come
out
of
a
forest
to
a
town
bursting
with
tourist
operations,
shops
selling
trinkets,
hippie
clothing,
multinational
beverages.
I
look
back
towards
the
jungle,
with
its
thousands
of
species
of
living
beings,
its
hills,
rivers,
valleys,
and
rain
clouds
swirling,
upswelling.
Then
my
gaze
cursorily
moves
over
a
famous
quote
from
Nelson
Mandela,
painted
on
a
compound
wall,
“Education
is
the
most
powerful
weapon
with
which
you
can
change
the
world”.

My
first
thought
is
that
different
realities
can
be
juxtaposed
in
one
eye-sweep.
Second,
Mandela
was
not
a
pacifist.
Third,
there’s
a
premise
here
that
education
is
a
positive
thing,
and
that
there
is
a
shared
definition
of
education.
Fourth,
Hmmm,
that
sounds
like
propaganda,
it’s
a
statement
aiming
to
change
the
world.
Fifth,
if
the
word
‘weapon’
is
being
used,
surely
there’s
a
war
going
on,
or
theft,
injustice,
or
unspeakable
violence,
and
that
education
is
part
of
a
militant
struggle.
My
sixth
thought
is
that
that
quote
is
now
used
by
liberals,
right-wingers,
leftists,
corporate-types
and
has
over
two
million
hits
on
Google!
Just
goes
to
show
how
great
quotes
can
be
co-opted
to
serve
any
agenda!

Are
the
following
true
or
false,
or
just
inconvenient?

•
Modern
education
serves
the
corporate
mindset,
which
serves
a
psychopathic
mind-set
that
is
behind
planetary
destruction.

•
Modern
education
feeds
young
minds
and
bodies
into
the
industrial
machine.
It
does
this,
overtly
or
covertly,
by
destroying
traditional
forms
of
community
and
replacing
them
with
notions
of
the
global
workforce,
the
global
market.
By
doing
this
it
ends
up
serving
forces
of
capitalism,
industrialism,
and
a
system
that
rewards
the
elite.

•
Modern
education
fetishizes
abstraction.
It
rewards
adepts
of
abstraction
and
standardization.
By
starting
this
early
in
life,
the
body
becomes
subservient
to
concept
and
clock,
to
the
virtual,
the
distant
and
the
measurable.

Modern
schooling
fractures
the
individual
in
a
number
of
irreparable
ways.
The
fractures
are
complex,
and
many:
the
child
from
sustained
intimate
body
contact
with
mother,
with
family;
the
child
from
neighbors;
the
child’s
mind
from
its
body,
from
the
natural
environment,
common/community
sense,
the
land-base;
the
child
from
the
real
and
the
multi-dimensional
(to
the
abstract
and
the
virtual);
from
local
history
(to
someone
else’s
future
or
past);
the
child
from
wholeness
(towards
a
fragmentedness);
the
child
from
magic,
oral
histories,
gleaming
cosmologies,
peopled
and
alive
(to
facts
derived
by
unknown
people
and
machines);
the
child
from
living
beings
(to
inanimate
things);
the
child
from
rootedness
and
sense
of
place;
the
child
from
natural,
cyclical,
expansive
time.

Life
is
thus
reduced
to
a
matter
of
negotiating
between
split
worlds,
split
mind-bodies,
split
communities,
split
realities,
split
values,
split
responsibilities,
split
knowledge
domains,
split
geographies,
split
identities,
split
loyalties.
How
can
a
little
human
being
possibly
tolerate
this?

R
D
Laing
wrote:

“In
order
to
rationalize
our
industrial-military
complex,
we
have
to
destroy
our
capacity
to
see
clearly
any
more
what
is
in
front
of,
and
to
imagine
what
is
beyond,
our
noses.
Long
before
a
thermonuclear
war
can
come
about,
we
have
had
to
lay
waste
to
our
own
sanity.
We
begin
with
the
children.
It
is
imperative
to
catch
them
in
time.
Without
the
most
thorough
and
rapid
brainwashing
their
dirty
minds
would
see
through
our
dirty
tricks.
Children
are
not
yet
fools,
but
we
shall
turn
them
into
imbeciles
like
ourselves,
with
high
IQs,
if
possible.”

Is
it
a
stretch
of
imagination
that
school
life
is
a
continuous
process
of
disintegration
and
estrangement?
Study
after
study
guarantees
that,
by
the
end
of
formative
education,
few
children
have
healthy
levels
of
self-esteem
and
self-worth,
including
the
ones
who
worked
hard
and
proved
to
themselves
that
they
could
achieve
their
goals
and
desires.
How
many
students
leave
school
with
vibrant
connections
to
a
community
that
they
will
contribute
to,
as
it
has
contributed
to
them?
How
many
are
comfortable
in
their
skins?
How
many
remain
‘whole’?
The
subtext
for
graduates
of
schooling
goes
thus:
her
body
is
better
than
mine,
their
body
type
is
better
than
our
body
type;
his
mind
is
better
than
mine;
their
minds
are
better
than
ours.
Their
culture
is
better
than
mine:
television
says
it’s
so.

My
Kurchiya
friend,
a
superlative
tracker,
now
raises
his
children
on
a
diet
of
Animal
Planet
and
Discovery
channels,
homework,
white
rice,
white
sugar.
No
jungle
meat,
no
walks
on
the
wild
side.
I
ask
him
if
he
intends
to
teach
his
jungle
craft
to
his
children.
He
says
he
will,
that
he
wants
his
children
to
know
healing
with
plants
and
the
ways
of
animals,
but
that
he
also
wants
them
to
go
to
school.
Vidyabhyaasam
is
a
good
and
necessary
thing,
he
declares.
I
ask
him
about
Kurchiya
vidyabhyaasam
.
He
misunderstands
me
and
says
they
have
no
schools.
I
ask
him
how
they
teach
their
young.
He
replies
that
girls
and
boys
are
socialized
to
become
responsible
members
of
their
community,
with
different
sets
of
instructions
for
either
sex,
offered
by
elders
in
the
community
or
their
parents,
through
a
variety
of
rituals,
celebrations,
guidance
and
tasks.
Boys,
for
instance,
have
bows
made
for
them
when
they
are
very
small,
just
to
play
with,
and
then
they
start
accompanying
the
men
to
the
forest,
where
there
is
a
lot
to
learn
about
every
animal,
and
about
the
forest.

The
Kurchiyas
were
fierce
rebels
and
proud
fighters.
They
could
read
the
forest
better
than
you
and
I
can
read
a
book.
Now
they
work
for
wages,
and
their
children
go
to
school.
Once
they’ve
been
educated
and
urbanized,
their
bows
will
be
mass-produced
for
tourist
outlets;
their
elders
will
recount
tales
of
valor
to
travelers
in
homestays,
between
television
commercials;
and
their
amazing
bodies
will
succumb
to
various
forms
of
civilization-induced
diseases
like
diabetes,
hypertension
and
cancer.

An
oft-touted
development
mandate
goes
something
like
this,
“Get
the
children
in
school,
and
crime
rates
will
drop”.
The
more
I
see
the
effects
of
modern
civilization
the
more
I
think,
“Get
those
children
in
school,
make
them
extensions
of
the
machine,
and
the
living
world,
the
real
world,
including
themselves,
will
drop.”
