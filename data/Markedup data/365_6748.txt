Crooked
Hillary
,
Slick
Willy
,
and
the
entire
Clinton
Crime
Family
organization
represent
the
very
worst
of
a
corrupt
system
that
has
been
allowed
to
operate
for
far
too
long
.

“When
the
righteous
are
in
authority
,
the
people
rejoice:
but
when
the
wicked
beareth
rule
,
the
people
mourn
.

Donald
Trump’s
Argument
For
America:
WikiLeaks:
DNC
and
CNN
colluded
on
questions
for
Trump
,
Cruz
Newly
released
emails
from
WikiLeaks
suggest
that
the
Democratic
National
Committee
colluded
with
CNN
in
devising
questions
in
April
to
be
asked
of
then
-
Republican
primary
candidate
Donald
Trump
in
an
upcoming
interview
.
In
an
email
to
DNC
colleagues
on
April
25
with
the
headline
“Trump
Questions
for
CNN
,
”
a
DNC
official
with
the
email
username
asked
for
ideas
for
an
interview
to
be
conducted
by
CNN
anchor
Wolf
Blitzer
.
”Wolf
Blitzer
is
interviewing
Trump
on
Tues
ahead
of
his
foreign
policy
address
on
Wed
.
…
Please
send
me
thoughts
by
10:30
AM
tomorrow
.
”The
sender
of
the
email
would
seem
to
be
DNC
Research
Director
Lauren
Dillon
,
who
was
identified
in
previous
reports
of
DNC
emails
released
by
WikiLeaks
in
July
.
Stay
abreast
of
the
latest
developments
from
nation’
source
Jill
Stein
agrees
with
Donald
Trump
,
Crooked
Hillary
must
be
stopped
“Get
ready
for
war
with
Russia”
if
Hillary
Clinton
is
elected
president
,
said
progressive
Green
Party
presidential
nominee
Jill
Stein
.
“This
election
,
we
are
not
only
deciding
what
kind
of
world
we
will
have
,
but
whether
we
will
have
a
world
or
not
going
forward
,
”
Stein
warned
,
explaining
that
Clinton’s
trigger
-
happy
militarism
“is
a
mushroom
cloud
waiting
to
happen
.
”While
Stein
explained
that
the
dangers
posed
by
a
Clinton
presidency
are
“arguably
even
more
immediate
and
intense
.
”
,
Stein
blasted
Clinton’s
“warmongering”
that
“almost
singlehandedly”
brought
us
the
turmoil
in
Libya
and
could
lead
us
into
a
nuclear
war
if
Clinton
were
elected
president
.

Hillary
Loses
The
Left
While
Donald
Trump
has
been
consolidating
his
base
of
support
,
the
opposite
appears
to
be
happening
for
Democratic
nominee
Hillary
Clinton
,
who
seems
to
be
hemorrhaging
supporters
from
her
progressive
base
.
Clinton’s
long
-
running
rift
with
the
progressive
left
has
been
a
vulnerability
for
her
throughout
her
campaign
—
dating
back
to
the
Democratic
primary
.
Yet
,
in
the
closing
days
of
the
2016
campaign
,
the
rift
has
been
laid
bare
through
a
combination
of
WikiLeaks
revelations
,
a
series
of
high
-
profile
endorsements
for
Green
Party
presidential
nominee
Jill
Stein
from
progressives
like
Marc
Lamont
Hill
,
Cornel
West
,
and
Susan
Sarandon
,
as
well
as
polling
data
that
suggests
Trump’s
broad
populist
messaging
is
resonating
with
Democrat
-
leaning
voters
.
Contrary
to
the
narrative
perpetuated
by
corporate
media
,
many
prominent
liberals
are
now
expressing
their
belief
that
installing
Hillary
Clinton
,
a
“
corporatist
hawk
,
”
in
the
White
House
is
“
the
true
danger
”
and
would
be
“
more
dangerous
”
for
progressive
values
,
the
well
-
being
of
the
nation
,
and
the
stability
of
the
world
than
would
four
years
of
a
Donald
Trump
presidency
.
