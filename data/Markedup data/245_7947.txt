Girls

Forget
the
movies
that
set
aloof
men
against
love-seeking
women.
It
is
men
who
are
the
hopeless
romantics
much,
if
not
most
of
the
time.
And
they
express
this
extraordinary
naivety
by
engaging
in
stupid
behaviors
that
their
fathers
and
other
male
role
models
should
have
beaten
out
of
them.
Though
feminism,
demographic
trends,
and
socioeconomic
realities
encourage
women
to
be
entitled
prima
donnas,
men
add
to
the
feedback
loop
by
rewarding
modern-day
princesses.

Of
course,
there
are
sensible
exceptions
to
avoiding
the
following
behaviors.
A
time
and
a
place,
for
example,
can
be
found
for
defending
a
woman,
most
notably
your
mother
or
wife,
from
someone
else’s
verbal
or
physical
attack.
Likewise,
sometimes
emergencies
or
certain
serious
events
mean
you
should
put
your
priorities
aside
to
help
a
high-quality
woman
who
gives
long-term
value
to
your
life.
That
said,
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
acting
in
this
way
is
unnecessary,
time-consuming,
resource-draining,
and
plain
self-destructive
for
a
man.

So,
here
are
the
five
things
many
men
perversely
and
uselessly
keep
doing
for
women:
1.
Fighting
for
them

I
lost
count
long
ago
of
the
number
of
times
I
have
seen
a
man
step
in
to
save
a
woman
from
either
herself
or
a
slight
(usually
deserved)
against
her.
A
girl
will
behave
like
a
pork
chop
at
a
restaurant,
club
or
elsewhere,
picking
a
verbal
or
even
physical
argument
with
an
employee
or
fellow
patron.
Along
comes
Captain-Save-a-Ho,
who
might
not
even
know
the
girl,
to
protect
her
honor.
The
expectation
of
many
women
that
men
will
do
this
for
them
is
bad
enough,
let
alone
when
a
man
does
it
of
his
own
volition,
without
being
requested.

In
return
for
risking
a
physical
or
similar
altercation
with
other
people,
the
white
knight
invariably
gets
a
smile,
a
few
words,
and
perhaps
a
phone
number.
From
this
point
onwards,
though,
the
interaction
between
Mr.
White
Knight
and
the
Entitled
Damsel
Who
Causes
Her
Own
Distress
invariably
fizzles
out.
And
it
is
not
just
members
of
your
typical
white
knight
crowd
who
act
this
way.
Men
who
are
nominally
good
with
women
fall
into
this
trap,
too,
confusing
it
with
the
opportunity
to
be
“alpha”
and
dominate
over
another
male.
The
most
common
outcome,
sadly,
is
that
a
woman’s
very
poor
behavior
is
condoned
by
a
man
falling
over
himself
to
be
her
medieval
champion.
2.
Fighting
over
them
Not
only
is
this
bickering
usually
ill-advised,
it
is
often
exactly
what
she
wants.

This
stupid
behavior
is
only
marginally
better
than
fighting
for
women
and
the
two
activities
consistently
overlap.
Whilst
competition
in
life,
including
between
men
over
women,
should
be
largely
encouraged,
swathes
of
men
are
effectively
scrapping
over
last
Sunday’s
leftovers
on
a
Saturday,
three
days
after
the
refrigerator
stopped
working.

Remember:
a
woman
can
be
attractive
but,
because
of
her
attitude
and
behavior,
have
very
little
long-term
value
for
you.
Countless
men
live
with
the
illusion
that
if
they
toil
hard
enough
to
get
the
good-looking
girl,
it
must
be
worth
it.
That’s
simply
not
the
case
in
modern
times.
To
boot,
a
lot
of
sexually
thirsty
men
nowadays
are
chasing
physically
low-yield
women
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
would
never
have
noticed.

At
best,
the
majority
of
men
who
fight
over
women
are
dueling
over
the
prospect
of
snaring
a
girl
who
one
of
them
will
probably
fuck
a
few
times,
if
at
all.
And
if
they
do
manage
to
secure
the
girl
for
a
long-term
relationship,
the
pairing
usually
implodes
down
the
track.
The
man
either
realizes
he
wasted
his
time
or
suffers
greatly
in
material
terms,
such
as
by
being
draped
(divorce
raped).

In
the
meantime,
the
girls
being
fought
over
have
their
egos
stroked
time
and
time
again.
Unattractive
girls
see
themselves
as
attractive
and
attractive
girls
with
foul,
entitled
princess
personalities
find
themselves
validated
once
more.
Everything
in
these
situations
is
predicated
on
the
men
fighting
and
proving
themselves,
rather
than
the
women
reaching
an
appropriate
standard
of
physical
and
emotional
femininity.
3.
Paying
for
them
What
are
you
getting
from
the
transaction
with
her?
And
yes,
everything
is
transactional
in
male-female
relationships.

Unless
you
are
completely
sure
you
have
claimed
the
world’s
best
girl
for
yourself
(and
even
that
belief
is
probably
based
on
very
false
or
temporary
appearances),
you
should
ideally
be
investing
less
financially
in
the
relationship
than
she
is.
This
may
seem
counterintuitive,
especially
when
a
man
is
sexually
valued
by
women
for
his
status,
achievements,
and
resources.
But
we
are
not
living
in
a
time
when
almost
every
woman
is
marriageable.
A
man
providing
for
a
woman
can
only
justify
it
if
she
is
of
high-quality
and
gives
him
something
back
in
return.
On
both
these
counts,
most
men
are
paying
for
dud
deals.

In
every
long-term
relationship
I
have
had,
I
have
put
less
into
the
relationship
financially,
proportionally-speaking.
Almost
always,
even
the
girl’s
gross
investment
has
either
approximated
mine
or
surpassed
it.
For
dates
and
during
casual
relationships,
too,
I
pay
for
a
woman’s
time
about
as
much
as
she
pays
for
mine,
if
not
less.

When
relationships
end,
girls
can
and
do
play
petty
games
over
money
or
property
you
may
be
owed.
What
matters,
however,
is
how
you
conduct
yourself
overall.
Only
when
a
woman
has
materially
invested
in
you
or
invests
in
you
should
you
invest
in
her.
When
patriarchy
returns,
the
male-female
dynamic
will
alter.
Before
that
time,
be
sure
she
does
her
fair
share
financially.
4.
Shifting
or
sacrificing
their
priorities
for
them
Meanwhile,
he
should
be
do
everything
else
for
himself.

Unlike
many
other
self-destructive
behaviors
concerning
women,
this
one
can
be
very
incremental
and
hard
to
spot.
It
is
very
easy
to
procrastinate
on
your
work,
final
exams,
self-development
goals,
and
the
rest
of
your
social
life
when
what
you
feel
is
a
high-quality
woman
comes
along.
In
fact,
nature
has
basically
designed
you
to
do
that
by
throwing
your
biochemistry
into
a
drug-like
dependency
at
the
beginning
of
a
courtship.
In
addition
to
these
problems
early
on,
men
are
apt
to
continue
the
shelving
of
their
other,
more
personal
demands
after
the
relationship
is
well
established.

On
a
topic
I
will
explore
in
more
detail
in
another
article,
there
should
be
certain
hours
in
many
days
(or
simply
days
in
general)
in
which
women
do
not
even
enter
your
mind.
Contrast
this
with
your
average
man,
who
will
throw
away
opportunities
to
further
himself
to
please
his
girl.
And
often
she’s
not
his
girl
for
much
longer,
as
his
neglect
of
himself
becomes
apparent
in
her
less
attracted
mind.
By
devoting
yourself
to
a
ho,
you
become
dispensable
to
a
ho,
not
just
psychologically,
but
physically,
financially,
and
socially
as
well.
Don’t
let
yourself
rot

Your
body,
finances,
education,
and
other
forms
of
self-improvement
need
to
be
your
number
one
focus.
After
all,
they
are
the
only
things
you
have
(or
don’t
have)
24
hours
a
day,
365
days
a
year.
Individual
girls
may
come
and
go,
but
your
obligations
to
yourself
remain.
Paradoxically,
keeping
these
obligations
to
yourself
are
what
attract
girls
in
the
first
place.
A
man
who
takes
proper
care
of
his
money,
career,
body,
and
social
life
gets
women.
5.
Moving
to
them,
for
them
Sucker.

This
is
the
one
even
my
leftwing
father
warned
me
about.
But
it’s
something
a
lot
of
guys
are
yet
to
learn.
Like
shifting
or
sacrificing
one’s
priorities,
moving
to
a
girl
for
a
girl
is
conducive
to
throwing
your
own
needs
into
utter
disarray.
Every
time
I
moved
to
where
a
girl
of
mine
lived,
I
did
so
mostly
for
myself.
Whether
to
explore
a
new
country
for
three
months,
or
find
a
new,
refreshing
place
to
get
my
work
done,
the
relocation
benefited
me.
This
is
qualitatively
far
different
from
upending
yourself
to
some
new
city
for
the
mere
chance
to
thrive
and
the
desire
to
please
a
girl.

Perhaps
the
saddest
thing
about
the
man
who
moves
for
his
girl
is
that
when
he
wants
even
a
fraction
of
the
favor
he
gave
her,
he’s
often
left
in
the
lurch.
Don’t
make
this
mistake.
Either
she
must
move
to
you
or
you
move
to
her
for
a
lot
of
reasons
that
don’t
revolve
around
her.
If
the
relationship
fails
(and
most
of
them
do),
you
leave
yourself
in
an
equal
or
better
position
than
the
one
you
would
otherwise
be
in.
Don’t
follow
the
crowd
of
thirsty
males
Too
many
men
slave
away
in
a
female
desert.
Girls
are
not
non-existent,
but
they’re
too
often
low-quality
relative
to
what
a
man
is
willing
to
do
for
them.

Snap
yourself
out
of
these
behaviors
and
help
your
friends
shake
them
off,
too.
You
may
not
indulge
in
them
regularly,
but
the
temptation
to
perform
them
at
least
sometimes
is
likely
to
be
there.
More
broadly,
we
need
to
see
a
seismic
shift
in
the
way
many
men
act.
Become
part
of
the
solution.

So
what’s
just
as
bad
as
an
entitled
woman?
A
man
who
encourages
her
entitlement
with
obsequious
validation.
