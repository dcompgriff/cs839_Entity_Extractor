Newly
released
emails
from
Wikileaks
show
Hillary
Clinton
staffers
debating
how
they
can
best
use
the
death
of
a
black
man
to
further
their
agenda.

The
email
began
as
a
request
for
an
essay
by
Clinton
from
Marie
Claire
who
was
partnering
with
Harvard
University
on
a
study
about
women
and
guns
but
it
quickly
devolved
into
brainstorming
ideas
on
how
to
push
the
campaign’s
anti-gun
and
racial
narratives.

The
team
began
discussing
an
article
published
in
“The
Guardian”
where
the
mother
of
Jordan
Davis,
a
black
teenager
murdered
by
a
white
man
for
playing
music
loud,
called
the
killing
a
“legal
lynching”
despite
the
fact
that
the
murderer,
Michael
David
Dunn,
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
life
in
prison.

De’Ara
Balenger,
the
director
of
engagement
for
“Hillary
for
America”
could
hardly
contain
her
excitement.

“This
is
great,”
she
wrote.
“The
only
flag
here
is
that
Jordan
Davis
was
killed
by
a
white
man,
so
arguably
–
this
crime
was
racially
motivated,
which
takes
this
outside
the
discussion
of
gun
violence.

Imagine
if
a
Republican
staffer
had
said
this.
