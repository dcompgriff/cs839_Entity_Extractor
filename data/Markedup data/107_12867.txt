A
new
WikiLeaks
email
from
John
Podesta’s
account
reveals
the
Clinton
campaign
manager
was
worried
about
internal
leaks
and
plotted
to
“
make
an
example
of
a
suspected
leaker
”
by
punishing
them
with
“
beyond
internal
discipline
”–
whether
or
not
there
was
“
any
real
basis
for
it.
“

Responding
to
an
email
from
John
Benenson
about
a
“
damaging
”
leak,
Podesta
wrote,
“
I
generally
agree
with
the
point,
but
we
need
a
strategy
on
this
that
goes
beyond
internal
discipline.
“

As
well
as
exposing
the
Clinton
camp
as
the
kind
of
organization
that
punishes
people
based
on
suspicion
alone,
the
question
of
what
“
beyond
internal
discipline
”
means
is
raised
–
and
in
light
of
recent
events
the
answers
may
be
grim.

Joel
Benenson
said,
“
I
think
we
have
to
make
examples
now
of
people
who
have
violated
the
trust
of
HRC
and
the
rest
of
the
team
.”
Later
in
the
email
chain
Robbie
Mook
replied
to
Podesta’s
message,
saying
“
I
would
love
an
example
being
made.”

The
revelation
of
Podesta’s
plan
to
punish
a
suspected
leaker
with
“
serious
consequences
”
takes
on
a
chilling
aspect
considering
the
fate
of
Seth
Rich,
the
Democratic
National
Committee
employee
widely
suspected
of
blowing
the
whistle
on
his
employers.
Rich
was
murdered
in
July
and
the
case
remains
unsolved.

Speaking
on
Nieuwsuur,
a
Dutch
news
channel,
Julian
Assange
said
that
Rich’s
murder
was
a
cause
of
concern
for
WikiLeaks’
whistleblowers.

“There
is
a
27
year
old
who
worked
for
the
DNC
who
was
shot
in
the
back
–
murdered
–
just
a
few
weeks
ago,
for
unknown
reasons
as
he
was
walking
down
the
street
in
Washington
.”

Asked
by
the
host
if
Seth
Rich
was
a
WikiLeaks
source,
Assange
said,
“
I
am
suggesting
that
our
sources
take
risks
and
they
become
concerned
to
see
things
occurring
like
that
.”

They
will
be
more
concerned
after
learning
the
Clinton
campaign
is
the
kind
of
organization
that
“
makes
examples
”
of
people
they
are
suspicious
about
–
with
or
without
having
“
any
real
basis
for
it
.”
