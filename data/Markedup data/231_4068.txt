Just
a
week
before
Election
Day
,
the
crisis
gripping
the
American
ruling
class
and
its
state
,
marked
by
intractable
and
bitter
internal
conflicts
,
has
erupted
into
open
political
warfare
.

Last
Friday’s
letter
from
<[>Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation<]>
Director
James
Comey
to
Congress
announcing
new
“investigative
steps”
in
the
probe
of
Democratic
presidential
candidate
Hillary
Clinton
,
itself
a
manifestation
of
the
crisis
,
has
brought
the
underlying
tensions
to
the
boiling
point
.
It
has
exposed
raging
conflicts
within
the
<[>FBI<]>
and
,
more
broadly
,
the
national
security
apparatus
as
a
whole
.

Comey’s
cryptic
letter
acknowledged
that
the
<[>FBI<]>
has
not
actually
reviewed
a
new
batch
of
emails
that
“appear
to
be
pertinent”
to
its
previous
investigation
into
Clinton’s
use
of
a
private
email
server
for
official
business
while
she
was
secretary
of
state
.
The
agency
,
he
wrote
,
“cannot
yet
assess
whether
or
not
this
material
may
be
significant
.
”
This
astonishing
admission
makes
all
the
more
extraordinary
Comey’s
decision
to
make
the
discovery
of
the
new
emails
a
public
issue
only
eleven
days
before
the
election
.

In
a
rapid
-
fire
series
of
developments
this
weekend
,
<[>Justice
Department<]>
officials
revealed
that
they
had
opposed
Comey’s
decision
to
send
the
letter
,
arguing
that
it
violated
a
longstanding
principle
that
no
<[>Justice
Department<]>
or
<[>FBI<]>
action
that
might
impact
on
a
candidate
should
be
announced
within
60
days
of
an
election
.

The
Clinton
campaign
and
congressional
Democrats
lashed
out
at
Comey
for
the
timing
of
the
letter
.
At
a
campaign
rally
in
Daytona
Beach
,
Florida
,
Clinton
said
Comey’s
action
is
“not
just
strange
,
it’s
unprecedented
.
”
She
also
tweeted
that
<[>FBI<]>
Director
Comey
bowed
to
partisan
pressure
,
”
suggesting
that
the
letter
was
an
effort
to
appease
congressional
Republican
leaders
opposed
to
Comey’s
determination
last
July
that
there
was
no
basis
for
criminal
charges
against
Clinton
over
her
use
of
a
private
email
server
.

Democratic
Senate
Minority
Leader
Harry
Reid
sent
a
letter
to
Comey
suggesting
that
he
had
violated
the
law
forbidding
government
employees
to
use
their
official
positions
to
influence
the
result
of
an
election
.
“I
am
writing
to
inform
you
that
my
office
has
determined
that
these
actions
may
violate
the
Hatch
Act
,
”
he
wrote
.
“Through
your
partisan
actions
,
you
may
have
broken
the
law
.
”

He
added
that
Comey
had
“demonstrated
a
disturbing
double
standard
for
the
treatment
of
sensitive
information
,
with
what
appears
to
be
clear
intent
to
aid
one
political
party
over
another
,
”
because
he
had
made
public
the
renewed
FBI
interest
in
Clinton’s
emails
,
but
was
silent
on
what
Reid
called
“explosive
information”
supposedly
connecting
Republican
presidential
candidate
Donald
Trump
to
Russian
government
officials
.

Here
Reid
was
resorting
to
the
Russia
-
baiting
that
has
been
the
Clinton
campaign’s
main
response
to
the
publication
by
<[>WikiLeaks<]>
of
tens
of
thousands
of
emails
and
other
documents
sent
or
received
by
campaign
chairman
John
Podesta
,
including
devastating
information
on
Bill
Clinton’s
use
of
the
Clinton
Foundation
to
obtain
lucrative
speaking
engagements
with
corporations
and
business
associations
.
Campaign
spokesmen
have
refused
to
discuss
the
contents
of
the
emails
,
claiming
that
they
were
hacked
by
Russian
government
agents
and
then
handed
over
to
<[>WikiLeaks<]>
to
damage
Clinton
and
help
Trump
.

<[>NBC
News<]>
reported
Sunday
that
the
<[>FBI<]>
has
now
obtained
a
search
warrant
to
go
through
all
650
,
000
emails
found
on
the
laptop
of
former
congressman
Anthony
Weiner
,
the
estranged
husband
of
Clinton’s
closest
aide
,
Huma
Abedin
.
Weiner
is
under
<[>FBI<]>
investigation
for
allegedly
sending
sexually
explicit
text
messages
to
an
underage
girl
.

The
<[>Wall
Street
Journal<]>
gave
details
,
in
a
story
posted
on
its
web
site
Sunday
afternoon
,
of
the
explosive
internal
crisis
within
the
<[>FBI<]>
that
led
to
Comey’s
letter
to
<[>Congress<]>
.
By
this
account
,
there
has
been
a
fierce
battle
within
the
<[>FBI<]>
and
between
the
<[>FBI<]>
and
the
<[>Justice
Department<]>
not
only
over
the
Clinton
email
investigation
,
but
over
separate
investigations
involving
four
<[>FBI<]>
field
offices
(
New
York
,
Washington
DC
,
Los
Angeles
and
Little
Rock
,
Arkansas
)
into
the
operations
of
the
<[>Clinton
Foundation<]>
.

More
than
eight
months
ago
,
<[>FBI<]>
agents
presented
plans
for
a
more
aggressive
investigation
of
the
foundation
to
career
prosecutors
in
the
<[>Justice
Department<]>
,
only
to
have
the
proposal
blocked
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
.
The
<[>FBI<]>
offices
nonetheless
continued
their
investigations
,
which
were
intensified
after
the
Clinton
email
investigation
was
wound
up
in
July
.

The
Journal
report
suggests
that
either
a
substantial
faction
within
the
<[>FBI<]>
was
convinced
that
top
<[>FBI<]>
officials
were
covering
up
criminal
activities
on
the
part
of
Hillary
and
Bill
Clinton
,
or
the
<[>FBI<]>
dissidents
were
politically
motivated
to
use
agency
resources
to
undermine
Hillary
Clinton’s
presidential
campaign
,
or
both
.

When
top
officials
in
the
<[>FBI<]>
and
<[>Justice
Department<]>
opposed
these
efforts
,
open
rebellion
followed
,
expressed
in
leaks
to
the
<[>Wall
Street
Journal<]>
centrally
targeting
<[>FBI<]>
Deputy
Director
Andrew
McCabe
,
whose
wife
was
an
unsuccessful
Democratic
candidate
for
<[>state
senate<]>
in
Virginia
last
year
.
According
to
some
press
reports
,
Comey
sent
his
letter
to
<[>Congress<]>
last
week
because
he
was
convinced
the
information
would
become
public
anyway
through
further
leaks
by
<[>FBI<]>
subordinates
.

The
open
warfare
engulfing
Washington
on
the
eve
of
a
presidential
election
reveals
that
the
entire
political
system
and
the
state
apparatus
itself
are
riven
by
tensions
and
conflicts
so
deep
and
bitter
that
they
cannot
be
contained
within
the
traditional
framework
of
bourgeois
elections
.
Fueling
these
tensions
is
the
convergence
of
crises
on
the
economic
,
geopolitical
,
internal
political
and
social
fronts
.

The
US
and
world
economy
remain
mired
in
stagnation
more
than
eight
years
after
the
2008
Wall
Street
crash
,
and
there
are
growing
fears
that
central
bank
policies
designed
to
buttress
the
banks
and
drive
up
stock
prices
are
leading
to
a
new
financial
disaster
.
The
economic
crisis
is
fueling
social
anger
and
alienation
from
the
entire
political
system
,
as
reflected
in
different
ways
in
the
mass
support
for
the
anti
-
Wall
Street
campaign
of
the
self
-
styled
“socialist”
Bernie
Sanders
and
the
“America
first”
pseudo
-
populist
campaign
of
Donald
Trump
.
