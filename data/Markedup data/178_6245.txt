No
matter
how
bad
things
are
at
<[>CalPERS<]>
,
the
giant
pension
fund
seems
determined
to
make
them
worse
.

This
Thursday
,
November
3
,
the
<[>California
State
Personnel
Board<]>
is
set
to
approve
changes
to
the
job
description
of
the
<[>CalPERS’<]>
Chief
Actuary
that
are
depicted
as
minor
but
are
anything
but
.
We
get
to
the
<[>CalPERS<]>
job
description
shortly
,
but
as
<[>Purdue’s<]>
mathematics
department
describes
the
terrain
:

An
actuary
is
a
business
professional
who
analyzes
the
financial
consequences
of
risk
.
Actuaries
use
mathematics
,
statistics
,
and
financial
theory
to
study
uncertain
future
events
,
especially
those
of
concern
to
insurance
and
pension
programs
.

The
proposed
changes
both
amount
to
a
violation
of
the
California
Constitution
by
attempting
to
end
the
required
role
of
the
board
in
policy
-
making
,
and
separately
so
far
reducing
the
minimum
qualifications
for
the
job
that
they
will
be
lower
than
that
for
the
most
junior
actuaries
now
employed
at
<[>CalPERS<]>
.
Needless
to
say
,
that
makes
a
mockery
of
the
claim
that
<[>CalPERS<]>
needs
to
dumb
down
the
job
description
so
severely
to
fill
the
post
.
<[>CalPERS<]>
could
promote
someone
from
inside
by
relaxing
the
requirements
less
or
not
at
all
.

One
has
to
assume
that
the
motivation
for
allowing
a
person
who
would
be
deemed
to
be
grossly
unqualified
under
current
rules
to
be
hired
in
the
Chief
Actuary
is
that
the
new
CEO
,
Marcie
Frost
,
has
someone
specific
she’d
like
to
bring
in
.
The
fact
that
Frost
herself
does
not
have
a
college
degree
and
certainly
does
not
have
the
mathematical
chops
to
evaluate
an
actuary’s
professional
competence
certainly
looks
like
she
is
giving
personal
loyalty
far
too
much
weight
in
a
role
where
analytical
rigor
and
professionalism
are
of
paramount
importance
.

This
move
troublingly
resembles
<[>CalPERS’<]>
decision
to
hire
a
similarly
unqualified
party
,
Robert
Klausner
,
in
another
important
role
,
that
of
fiduciary
counsel
.
Recall
that
Klausner
was
not
a
member
of
the
California
bar
,
yet
in
public
board
sessions
,
was
giving
advice
on
California
law
matters
such
as
its
Public
Records
Act
.
As
we
pointed
out
,
his
advice
was
contrary
to
statute
.
To
make
matters
worse
,
Klausner
had
a
long
track
record
of
being
involved
in
pay
-
to
-
play
scandals
and
of
telling
clients
what
they
wanted
to
hear
,
regardless
of
whether
he
could
come
up
with
a
sound
legal
basis
for
validating
their
actions
.
As
California
attorney
Karl
Olson
wrote
of
Klausner:

This
isn’t
a
case
of
the
fox
guarding
the
henhouse
;
this
may
be
a
case
of
<[>CalPERS<]>
going
across
the
country
to
hire
a
fox
who
specialized
in
building
henhouses
with
no
gates
.

But
what
could
possibly
be
foxy
about
the
historically
dull
green
-
eyeshade
role
of
Chief
Actuary
?

Recall
that
the
biggest
controversy
that
<[>CalPERS<]>
is
facing
now
,
and
one
that
is
not
going
away
any
time
soon
,
is
its
underfunding
problem
and
its
refusal
to
cut
its
return
assumptions
.
<[>CalPERS’<]>
just
-
retired
former
Chief
Actuary
,
Alan
Milligan
,
repeatedly
stated
that
he
thought
the
pension
fund
needed
to
lower
its
return
target
,
and
repeated
that
view
in
his
final
appearances
before
the
board
in
August
and
September
.
Given
the
recent
salvo
of
articles
excoriating
<[>CalPERS<]>
for
its
refusal
to
reduce
its
return
targets
save
on
a
very
attenuated
basis
that
many
regard
as
unrealistic
,
<[>CalPERS<]>
must
be
relieved
that
journalists
were
too
inattentive
to
pick
up
on
the
fact
that
the
agency
was
disregarding
the
advice
of
its
own
designated
risk
expert
.
No
doubt
the
agency
is
keen
to
get
an
actuary
in
place
that
won’t
take
positions
that
could
make
its
hard
-
to
-
defend
posture
even
more
untenable
.

Now
let
us
address
the
particulars
of
<[>CalPERS’<]>
chicanery
with
its
Chief
Actuary
job
search
.

The
Chief
Actuary
is
such
an
important
role
that
until
the
board
decided
to
quit
doing
its
job
and
rubber
stamp
pretty
much
everything
staff
wanted
to
do
,
it
was
one
of
four
direct
reports
to
the
board
.
Reducing
the
number
of
direct
reports
to
one
has
substantially
reduced
the
board’s
power
.
If
it
was
unhappy
with
the
activities
of
staff
,
it
could
threaten
to
fire
one
of
the
direct
reports
other
than
the
CEO
,
which
gave
it
more
surgical
ways
to
intervene
.
Now
it
has
only
the
nuclear
option
of
defenestrating
the
CEO
.

The
Chief
Actuary
,
indeed
all
the
actuary
positions
at
<[>CalPERS<]>
,
is
a
job
classification
that
is
specific
to
<[>CalPERS<]>
.
From
a
letter
from
an
Baldwin
,
Chief
Personnel
Management
Division
,
to
the
<[>Personnel
Board<]>
from
the
document
at
the
end
of
the
post:

The
Chief
Actuary
is
appointed
to
this
single
-
incumbent
,
statutory
position
and
serves
as
a
key
member
of
the
<[>CalPERS<]>
Executive
Management
team
,
the
incumbent
provides
guidance
on
all
actuarial
issues
facing
<[>CalPERS<]>
,
including
actuarial
investigations
and
valuations
,
rate
structure
,
health
benefits
and
reserve
funds
.
The
Chief
Actuary
promotes
the
sound
and
secure
operation
of
<[>CalPERS<]>
enterprises
through
the
oversight
of
all
functions
within
the
<[>ACTO<]>
[
<[>Actuarial
Office<]>
]
,
and
is
responsible
for
the
evaluation
,
development
,
and
implementation
of
actuarial
policies
and
procedures
.

The
revisions
to
the
proposed
role
violate
the
California
constitution
by
eliminating
any
reporting
relationship
between
the
board
and
the
Chief
Actuary
.
On
page
4
of
the
document
below:

First
,
it’s
disturbing
to
see
the
lengths
to
which
the
<[>State
Personnel
Board<]>
is
willing
to
collude
with
<[>CalPERS<]>
in
disguising
the
fact
that
this
job
classification
applies
ONLY
to
<[>CalPERS<]>
.
By
eliminating
any
reference
to
<[>CalPERS<]>
,
unexperienced
investigators
would
mistakenly
assumed
that
the
greatly
-
watered
down
job
requirements
apply
to
all
state
agencies
that
have
actuarial
groups
and
thus
have
a
senior
actuary
in
charge
,
such
as
<[>CalSTRS<]>
and
the
<[>State
Department
of
Insurance<]>
.
The
very
fact
of
this
cover
-
up
alone
is
a
sign
that
<[>CalPERS<]>
knows
it
is
up
to
no
good
and
is
desperate
to
cover
its
tracks
.

Second
,
look
at
the
first
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph
as
it
is
proposed
to
read
(
emphasis
ours
)
:

Under
the
policy
direction
and
administrative
direction
of
the
organization’s
executive
and/or
director
leve
l
,
to
manage
the
actuarial
and
employer
services
functions
of
the
organization
;
to
provide
expert
actuarial
advice
and
consultation
to
the
organization’s
executive
and/or
director
level
;
and
to
do
other
related
work
.

This
is
an
express
violation
of
the
California
Constitution
.
Article
XVI
,
section
17
(
e
)
states
:

The
retirement
board
of
a
public
pension
or
retirement
system
,
consistent
with
the
exclusive
fiduciary
responsibilities
vested
in
it
,
shall
have
the
sole
and
exclusive
power
to
provide
for
actuarial
services
in
order
to
assure
the
competency
of
the
assets
of
the
public
pension
or
retirement
system
.

Notice
the
use
of
“exclusive
and
“sole
and
exclusive
.
”
At
a
bare
minimum
,
the
board
needs
to
retain
policy
oversight
,
but
even
that
is
being
stripped
away
in
the
new
job
description
.
The
board
will
have
absolutely
nada
to
do
with
the
actuarial
function
.
Also
bear
in
mind
that
the
changes
in
the
proposed
language
,
at
least
as
far
as
I
can
tell
from
looking
at
recent
board
meetings
,
were
never
reviewed
or
approved
by
the
board
.
This
is
a
naked
power
grab
by
staff
relying
on
long
-
standing
complacency
of
<[>CalPERS’<]>
board
.

Even
more
stunning
is
how
this
senior
role
is
being
downgraded
.
Note
that
all
positions
in
the
current
set
of
the
existing
<[>CalPERS<]>
pension
actuary
job
series
,
from
“Associate
Pension
Actuary”
through
and
including
“Supervising
Pension
Actuary”
require
that
the
employee
have
an
Associateship
in
the
<[>Society
of
Actuaries<]>
.
The
<[>Society
of
Actuaries<]>
website
states
:

Requirements
include
examinations
,
an
e
-
Learning
course
,
validation
of
educational
experiences
outside
the
<[>SOA<]>
Education
system
(
<[>VEE<]>
)
,
and
a
professionalism
seminar
.

Notice
that
the
new
job
description
allows
for
minimum
qualifications
to
instead
be
satisfied
by
“Membership
in
the
<[>American
Academy
of
Actuaries”<]>
.
What
,
pray
tell
,
is
the
<[>“American
Academy
of
Actuaries”<]>
?

It
is
not
a
professional
organization
.
One
can
be
member
without
satisfying
any
professional
credentialing
requirements
.
For
instance
,
one
can
become
a
member
via
being
a
member
of
the
<[>“Conference
of
Consulting
Actuaries”<]>
which
in
turn
allows
for
“Membership
for
NonSOA/CAS
Credentialed
Actuaries”

All
actuaries
not
credentialed
by
the
<[>Society
of
Actuaries<]>
or
the
<[>Casualty
Actuarial
Society<]>
are
required
to
sign
off
on
a
form
acknowledging
professional
awareness
of
the
Qualification
Standards
and
professionalism
for
actuaries
prior
to
processing
his/her
application
(
required
by
the
<[>International
Actuarial
Association<]>
)
.

In
other
words
,
without
even
looking
hard
,
there
is
a
route
to
become
a
member
of
the
<[>American
Academy
of
Actuaries<]>
by
saying
you’ve
heard
about
actuarial
professional
ethics
.
You
don’t
even
have
to
say
you
believe
in
them
,
just
that
you
know
they
exist
!
Although
there
is
a
continuing
education
requirement
for
the
<[>Conference
of
Consulting
Actuaries<]>
,
if
you
click
through
,
you
can
see
it
is
required
“
to
retain
the
status
of
FCA
or
ACA
”
meaning
Fellow
or
Associate
,
not
a
mere
“Member”
.

Needless
to
say
,
it
would
be
plenty
demotivating
to
<[>CalPERS’<]>
existing
staff
of
actuaries
to
have
a
new
boss
parachuted
in
above
them
who
hadn’t
gone
through
the
sort
of
minimum
professional
accreditation
they
were
required
to
meet
.
And
it
begs
the
question
as
to
why
<[>CalPERS’<]>
staff
is
so
desperate
to
consider
candidates
that
have
not
been
subjected
to
a
basic
requirement
of
passing
the
<[>Society
of
Actuaries’<]>
exams
.
Would
you
ever
consider
using
an
attorney
,
even
for
informal
advice
,
who
had
never
passed
a
bar
exam
?
Yet
<[>CalPERS<]>
and
the
<[>California
Department
of
Human
Resources<]>
are
about
to
put
in
place
a
job
description
that
would
let
someone
that
unqualified
in
actuarial
space
take
the
helm
at
<[>CalPERS<]>
.

With
the
vote
on
this
dangerous
change
set
to
take
place
on
Thursday
,
this
plot
is
too
far
advanced
for
the
usual
Naked
Capitalism
reader
route
of
writing
upset
missives
to
<[>CalPERS<]>
board
members
,
particularly
the
elected
members
who
have
reason
to
fear
the
wrath
of
voters
,
to
have
any
effect
.
I
hope
you’ll
forward
this
post
to
news
organizations
and
ask
them
to
look
into
this
pronto
,
since
this
story
is
time
sensitive
.

Here
are
some
candidates
,
but
feel
free
to
write
others
(
please
add
helpful
ideas
in
comments
,
particularly
how
to
contact
any
talk
radio
or
TV
hosts
who
might
take
up
this
story
)

He’s

<[>CalPERS<]>
returns
.

Jack
Dolan
(

dolan@latimes

)
at
the
<[>Los
Angeles
Times<]>
.
I
have
mixed
feelings
about
putting
Dolan
onto
this
,
since
his
last
story
on
<[>CalPERS<]>
was
seriously
distorted
(
his
report
grossly
exaggerated
the
cost
of
cost
of
allowing
“badges”
as
in
mainly
prison
guards
and
state
highway
officers
,
to
retire
early
and
tried
pinning
<[>CalPERS<]>
underfunding
on
that
,
when
it
is
due
to
not
continuing
to
fund
the
system
when
it
appeared
to
be
overfunded
in
the
dot
-
com
era
,
and
the
losses
it
took
in
the
financial
crisis
from
which
it
has
not
fully
recovered
)
.
However
,
with
<[>CalPERS<]>
in
the
cross
-
hairs
of
critics
,
it
needs
to
work
even
harder
at
being
above
reproach
instead
of
making
itself
vulnerable
to
fully
-
deserved
attacks
.
And
this
latest
development
would
certainly
fit
with
the
dim
view
he
has
of
the
system
.
However
,
he
may
only
do
longer
-
form
stories
and
something
faster
-
turnanround
may
not
suit
his
schedule
.
