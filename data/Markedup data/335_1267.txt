2016
presidential
campaign
by
BAR
executive
editor
Glen
Ford

The
GOP
won
at
the
polls
,
but
Black
,
brown
and
working
class
Democrats
have
been
taking
a
beating
from
their
own
party
for
decades
.
“The
Democratic
Party
has
failed
to
deliver
even
small
net
increments
of
social
justice
to
its
base
constituencies
,
always
giving
away
more
than
it
gained
,
and
at
times
taking
the
lead
in
savaging
the
people
.
”
Hillary
Clinton
hoped
to
lead
a
Government
of
Ruling
Class
Consensus
–
a
victory
only
for
the
One
Percent
.
The
Democratic
Debacle
–
The
Day
After
by
BAR
executive
editor
Glen
Ford

“The
net
economic
loss
to
the
people
-
-
especially
the
masses
of
Black
folks
,
who
have
been
stripped
of
much
of
the
gains
of
the
Sixties
and
Seventies
,
and
nearly
all
of
their
household
wealth
–
has
been
staggering
and
unrelenting
.
”

The
White
Nationalists
won
and
Hillary
Clinton’s
Big
Tent
,
the
bastion
of
the
ruling
class
that
Blacks
and
browns
were
led
to
believe
was
their
sanctuary
,
has
ignominiously
folded
.
The
media
echo
chamber
smothered
the
deep
,
rumbling
sounds
of
the
impending
quake
,
allowing
only
the
corporate
consensus
to
be
heard
outside
the
precincts
of
the
Deplorables
.
But
Deplorables
want
good
jobs
,
too
,
and
a
future
secure
from
the
predations
of
Mad
Capital
,
if
only
for
their
own
“kind
.
”
Whites
in
the
“Rust
Belt”
joined
with
Confederates
to
choose
their
own
brand
of
“lesser
evil”
–
evils
being
the
only
items
on
the
duopoly
menu
.

Social
democrats
–
a
broad
group
that
includes
the
vast
bulk
of
Black
America
,
according
to
political
scientist
Michael
Dawson
-
-
huddled
around
the
latrine
of
Hillary’s
Big
Tent
,
trying
desperately
to
perfume
the
stench
.
Except
for
a
few
percentage
points
worth
of
Green
voters
,
they
opted
,
once
again
,
for
a
fraudulent
“incrementalism”
–
a
foolishness
dressed
up
as
“pragmatism”
and
even
masquerading
as
high
“strategy”
-
-
which
has
led
“progressives”
straight
down
a
road
to
disaster
in
the
neoliberal
era
.
(
My
excessive
use
of
quotation
marks
is
intended
to
convey
that
even
the
language
of
much
leftish
discourse
is
crafted
for
the
purpose
of
surrender
to
Power
.

Rather
than
gradually
strengthening
the
political
hand
of
the
working
and
oppressed
classes
,
bit
by
bit
,
year
by
year
-
-
which
is
the
purported
justification
for
incrementalism
-
-
progressive
slavishness
to
the
Democratic
Party
has
facilitated
the
deepening
dictatorship
of
capital
.
The
net
economic
loss
to
the
people
-
-
especially
the
masses
of
Black
folks
,
who
have
been
stripped
of
much
of
the
gains
of
the
Sixties
and
Seventies
,
and
nearly
all
of
their
household
wealth
–
has
been
staggering
and
unrelenting
.

For
the
past
40
years
and
more
,
Democrats
have
been
perfect
partners
in
the
Dance
of
the
Duopolists
.
It’s
a
simple
two
-
step
.
The
basic
move
is:
the
Democrats
hug
as
closely
as
possible
to
the
left
flank
of
the
Republican
Party
,
thus
staying
within
dog
-
whistle
range
of
the
White
Man’s
Party’s
core
base
,
rooted
in
white
supremacy
,
while
claiming
everything
to
the
left
of
Robert
E
.
Lee
as
Democratic
turf
,
including
the
huge
,
heavily
Black
social
democratic
electorate
whose
progressive
agenda
the
Democrats
have
no
intention
of
substantively
addressing
.

The
Clintons
turned
this
two
-
step
into
a
disciplined
tango
with
their
GOP
partners
.
In
1994
,
the
Republicans
threatened
to
launch
a
social
justice
Armageddon
through
their
Contract
with
America
-
-
legislation
they
were
incapable
of
fully
enacting
,
however
,
without
some
level
of
Democratic
consent
.
The
Clintons
vowed
to
defend
Black
,
brown
and
poor
people
from
the
GOP
barbarians
at
the
gate
–
and
wound
up
ramming
through
Congress
corporate
-
crafted
measures
that
the
Republicans
could
not
have
passed
on
their
own
.
Bill
and
Hillary
cut
a
rug
to
that
tune
for
eight
years
in
the
White
House
,
stomping
out
welfare
as
we
knew
it
,
eviscerating
Franklin
Roosevelt’s
New
Deal
banking
regulations
,
presiding
over
the
largest
surge
in
mass
Black
incarceration
in
modern
history
,
and
delivering
the
broadcast
spectrum
to
monopoly
media
,
all
the
while
pretending
to
defend
a
“progressive
agenda
.
”

“Islamic
jihadists
were
enlisted
en
mass
as
U
.
S
.
imperialism’s
hellish
foreign
legion
in
the
Muslim
world
.
”

On
the
foreign
policy
side
,
the
Clintons
pioneered
Washington’s
“humanitarian”
military
intervention
doctrine
,
later
refined
by
Barack
Obama
and
his
secretary
of
state
,
Hillary
Clinton
.
In
the
Democratic
Republic
of
Congo
,
Bill
Clinton
set
in
motion
the
worst
genocide
since
World
War
Two
,
a
holocaust
that
has
killed
at
least
six
million
people
under
three
US
.
administrations
,
and
still
counting
.
Humanitarian
intervention
,
or
Responsibility
to
Protect
(
R2P
)
,
became
Obama’s
favored
instrument
of
aggression
,
a
more
domestically
palatable
alternative
to
George
Bush’s
massive
boots
-
on
-
the
-
ground
fiasco
in
Iraq
.
Islamic
jihadists
were
enlisted
en
mass
as
U
.
S
.
imperialism’s
hellish
foreign
legion
in
the
Muslim
world
.
Together
,
“New”
Democrats
Barack
Obama
and
Hillary
Clinton
turned
Syria
and
Libya
into
maelstroms
of
slaughter
and
moved
towards
nuclear
war
with
Russia
.

Obama’s
domestic
aggressions
on
behalf
of
Big
Capital
were
equally
bold
.
With
both
houses
of
Congress
in
Democratic
hands
and
the
GOP
on
the
ropes
in
2009
,
he
rushed
to
put
Social
Security
,
Medicare
and
“all
entitlements”
“on
the
table”
for
cutting
.
Now
dancing
by
himself
,
not
even
bothering
to
triangulate
in
the
Clinton
style
,
Obama
tried
to
forge
a
“Grand
Bargain”
with
the
GOP
by
pulverizing
the
remnants
of
the
social
safety
net
.
Only
the
Republicans'
institutional
imperative
to
defeat
,
rather
than
collaborate
with
,


-
-
its
white
supremacist
DNA
-
-
prevented
consummation
of
the
Grand
Bargain
,
Obama’s
Holy
Grail
.

From
Jimmy
Carter
to
Barack
Obama
,
the
Democratic
Party
has
failed
to
deliver
even
small
net
increments
of
social
justice
to
its
base
constituencies
,
always
giving
away
more
than
it
gained
,
and
at
times
taking
the
lead
in
savaging
the
people
.
There
is
no
historical
basis
in
the
neoliberal
era
for
the
claim
that
the
Democratic
Party
provides
net
incremental
benefits
to
Black
and
working
people
,
or
that
the
party
can
be
seized
from
its
corporate
masters
and
transformed
into
a
machine
that
fights
for
the
people
.
It
fights
for
Capital
–
tooth
and
nail
,
as
Bernie
Sanders’
followers
discovered
.

“The
First
Black
President
rushed
to
put
Social
Security
,
Medicare
and
‘all
entitlements’
‘on
the
table’
for
cutting
.
”

Hillary
Clinton
seized
the
opportunity
presented
by
the
Trump
-
generated
split
in
the
GOP
to
create
a
ruling
class
consensus
and
headquarters
in
her
own
campaign
tent
.
It
was
the
ultimate
betrayal
,
the
incubator
of
a
thoroughly
corporatized
Democratic
Party
–
an
undertaker
of
social
democracy
.
Instead
,
the
White
Deplorables
derailed
her
,
as
they
had
earlier
derailed
the
Republican
corporate
establishment
.

Thus
,
the
crisis
of
legitimacy
in
U
.
S
.
ruling
institutions
deepens
.

It
now
appears
,
in
the
early
hours
of
President
Elect
Donald
Trump
,
that
the
new
administration
will
be
a
conventional
rightwing
Republican
regime
,
with
a
cast
of
villains
including
Newt
“Contract
with
America”
Gingrich
,
and
a
Vice
President
Mike
Pence
in
the
role
of
Dick
“The
Real
President”
Cheney
.
Maybe
Trump
will
insist
on
giving
peace
with
Russia
and
China
a
chance
,
maybe
not
.
The
Trans
Pacific
Pipeline
is
probably
dead
,
unless
it
can
somehow
be
resurrected
in
the
lame
duck
session
of
Congress
that
begins
next
week
,
but
there
is
no
way
Republicans
or
Democrats
will
slap
35
percent
tariffs
on
U
.
S
.
corporations’
foreign
-
produced
goods
.
That’s
rhetorical
theater
a
la
Trump
.

The
Trump
regime
has
no
fix
for
the
ills
of
late
stage
capitalism
that
have
immiserated
both
the
triumphant
Deplorables
and
the
darker
folks
they
scapegoat
,
and
whom
they
can
be
counted
on
to
harass
,
repress
and
deport
.
Neither
does
the
Democratic
Party
,
whose
next
administration
,
had
it
not
been
still
-
born
,
would
have
served
the
interests
of
the
One
Percent
even
more
dependably
than
did
Obama
.

Leave
Hillary’s
nasty
tent
in
the
dirt
,
where
it
lies
.
The
people
need
vibrant
social
movements
that
will
produce
new
leadership
in
struggle
and
shape
the
parties
of
the
future
.
