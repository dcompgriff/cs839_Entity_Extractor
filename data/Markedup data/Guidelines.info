1. If not already done, convert the file to 1 word per line. Using presumably makeWords.py
2. Use Tag <[> at the start of entity mention
3. Use tag <]> at the end of the mention.
4. Entity can span multiple lines. Don't use a line for just tag alone. Tag and the first/last word in entity come on same line.
5. Entity are Institutions or Organizations, like Corporations, Educational, Teams, and Govt. departments (Include police like NYPD)
#6. Don't include political parties. (Include things like "Congress", and "Virginia Senate")
7. Can include Boy scouts etc as they can fall under educational
8. 8 word long institution maximum? (Maybe we need to tag only the first 8 words of an entity longer than 8?)
9. <[> should always be at the beginning of the line. Even if some punctuations get included
10. <]> should always be followed by a new line even if some punctuations get included on its line after the last word

# keep adding more rules here after confirming that with all. Need to keep tab on what rules we are following.

Should we include "Communications" from the mention "Director of Communications" ??
Should we include domain name "b.com" from email address "a@b.com"
"Wall Street"? No
"Hilary Clinton Campaign"?"HRC"? Yes
"Catholic Church"? "The Church"? Yes
"New York City Police Department" is <[>New York City Police Department<]>
"CNBC's" should be "<[>CNBC's<]>"
"The Greanville Post" should be "The <[>Greanville Post<]>"
"OSF ( Open Society Foundation )" should be "<[>OSF<]> ( <[>Open Society Foundation<]> )"
