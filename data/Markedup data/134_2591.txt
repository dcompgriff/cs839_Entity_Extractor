Vice
President
-
elect
Mike
Pence
was
attending
the
Broadway
Musical
“Hamilton”
on
Friday
night
when
the
cast
decided
to
send
a
political
message
to
Trump
and
his
administration
.

Brandon
Victor
Dixon
,
the
actor
who
played
the
part
of
Vice
President
Aaron
Burr
during
the
musical
about
the
life
of
the
Founding
Father
Alexander
Hamilton
,
acknowledged
that
Pence
was
in
the
crowd
and
then
said
the
following:

“We
,
sir
—
we
—
are
the
diverse
America
who
are
alarmed
and
anxious
that
your
new
administration
will
not
protect
us
,
our
planet
,
our
children
,
our
parents
,
or
defend
us
and
uphold
our
inalienable
rights
.
We
truly
hope
that
this
show
has
inspired
you
to
uphold
our
American
values
and
to
work
on
behalf
of
all
of
us
.
”

Dixon
was
asked
on
“CBS
This
Morning”
Monday
about
the
decision
to
deliver
his
political
message
,
which
prompted
Donald
Trump
to
take
to
Twitter
and
say
that
Pence
was
“harassed”
and
that
the
cast
was
“very
rude
.
”

“The
president
-
elect
is
demanding
an
apology
,
”
CBS
anchor
Charlie
Rose
said
to
Dixon
during
the
Monday
morning
interview
.

“I
heard
,
”
Dixon
responded
.

“We
assume
that
no
apology
is
forthcoming
?
”
Rose
asked
.

“There
is
nothing
to
apologize
for
,
”
Dixon
said
.

Dixon
then
added
that
this
is
“certainly
not
the
first
time
,
nor
will
it
be
the
last
,
that
somebody
went
into
a
theater
and
began
to
act
inappropriately
or
stand
up
and
interrupt
the
show
.
