Firearms
panics
happen
over
a
variety
of
things
,
like
acts
of
domestic
terrorism
,
mass
shootings
,
or
Democrats
getting
elected
to
office
.
Though
we
may
not
have
to
worry
about
this
for
a
few
years
after
2nd
Amendment
enthusiast
Donald
Trump’s
decisive
victory
last
night
,
let’s
cover
our
bases
and
talk
about
a
panic
if
future
Democrats
are
elected
.
What
is
a
panic
for
ammo
and
firearms
?
A
panic
is
when
people
go
and
buy
items
just
to
have
them
because
they
are
worried
that
there
will
soon
be
no
more
,
or
it
will
be
illegal
to
buy
and
sell
such
items
,
but
maybe
not
to
own
them
already
,
as
most
Americans
still
believe
in
the
no
ex
post
facto
laws
part
of
the
Constitution
.
Adding
to
a
panic
is
speculators
,
who
buy
from
retailers
who
are
roundly
shamed
if
they
raise
their
own
prices
,
only
to
resell
privately
at
much
higher
levels
.
While
this
is
legal
,
it
certainly
isn’t
ethical
or
a
decent
thing
to
do
,
and
these
folks
deserve
being
shamed
and
mocked
at
every
opportunity
.
Lastly
,
the
gun
store’s
or
site’s
inventory
cannot
handle
the
flex
in
the
buying
demand
,
nor
can
the
manufacturer
,
and
an
artificially
contrived
panic
creates
a
real
scarcity
that
can
only
be
corrected
by
the
panic
running
out
of
steam
as
everyone
buys
what
they
consider
to
be
enough
and
natural
undercutting
resets
the
price
back
to
lower
levels
.
Some
prices
never
return
.
22
Long
Rifle
ammunition
has
still
not
totally
recovered
from
the
damage
old
B
-
rock
“
the
Islamic
Shock
”
Obama
did
to
it
with
his
multi
-
year
championship
of
Best
Firearms
Salesman
Ever
,
and
it
may
be
even
worse
under
the
Bitch
in
Chief
.
So
,
what
gets
grabbed
in
a
panic
?
What
should
you
get
?
What
should
you
count
on
still
being
available
?
We’ve
got
three
categories
:
guns
,
ammo
,
and
components/accessories
.
Guns
Anything
that’s
big
on
the
liberal
hit
list
is
a
first
target
for
a
ban
,
so
it’s
a
first
target
for
a
panic
.
Look
for
things
that
are
popular
with
the
right
,
and
scary
to
the
left
.
Also
look
for
things
that
are
modern
;
no
one
is
going
to
ban
the
M1
Garand
anytime
soon
.
Evil
features
matter
more
than
destructive
power
.
Anyone
who
knows
anything
about
guns
knows
that
the
AK
-
47
and
the
AR
-
15
fire
intermediate
cartridges
that
are
puny
enough
to
be
considered
inhumane
in
several
states
with
which
to
hunt
deer
as
they
lack
the
power
to
kill
the
animal
with
marginal
shots
.
However
,
they’re
black
and
have
mean
things
attached
to
them
,
so
they’re
on
the
shit
list
,
while
a
nice
blued
with
wooden
stock
scoped
bolt
action
rifle
in
a
magnum
cartridge
capable
of
wrecking
your
world
from
twice
the
distance
that
an
AR
can
pull
is
safe
as
it
looks
“
traditional
.
”

They
have
to
be
popular
to
the
left
to
get
noticed
;
rifles
like
the
FAL
and
anything
based
of
the
G3/HK91
action
simply
don’t
have
enough
exposure
to
get
targeted
,
unless
they
pull
something
sweeping
like
the
USC
18
922r
rules
again
.
The
Mini
30
and
the
M1A
might
be
safe
;
maybe
.
For
pistols
,
pretty
much
any
semi
-
automatic
of
the
polymer
age
is
fair
game
to
want
banned
.
Oftentimes
,
stupid
rules
like
restrictive
magazine
sizes
get
pushed
.
1911s
,
Hi
Powers
,
other
old
domestic
semi
-
autos
,
and
revolvers
should
be
safe
.
Expect
the
libtards
to
go
after
Glocks
and
the
like
.
Shotguns
seem
to
be
immune
these
days
as
there’s
not
a
whole
lot
of
difference
between
a
hunting
gun
and
a
combat
gun
other
than
paint
and
mag
tube
length
.
I
think
the
Saigas
are
still
not
being
imported
,
and
it’s
about
the
only
box
mag
fed
one
out
there
,
but
anything
else
makes
a
good
home
defense
gun
that
should
also
be
immune
to
the
ammo
panic
portion
as
well
.
Ammunition
Range
(
full
metal
jacket
)
and
defense/hunting
(
hollow
or
soft
point
)
cartridges
in
popular
centerfire
calibers
and
22
Long
Rifle
will
almost
literally
evaporate
from
your
local
store
and
online
,
and
it’s
probably
beginning
as
I
write
this
.
Oddly
enough
,
only
certain
rounds
will
suffer
panic
buying
.
For
rifles
,
it’s
limited
to
.
223/5
.
56
,
7
.
62×39
,
and
.
308/7
.
62×51
.
Traditional
hunting
rounds
like
30
-
30
,
.
243
,
and
.
270
do
not
seem
to
be
impacted
.
Why
doesn’t
30
-
06
get
bought
in
a
panic
?
As
the
old
joke
goes
,
men
with
30
-
06’s
don’t
panic
,
but
it
really
has
to
do
with
the
feedback
cycle
I
mentioned
at
the
start
.
If
there’s
little
demand
,
it
cannot
exceed
the
in
-
store
supply
,
so
the
perception
of
it
being
gone
for
good
cannot
occur
.
Everything
but
the
shotgun
shell
and
the
howitzer
round
to
the
far
right
will
sell
fast
in
a
panic
.
Panic
bought
pistol
ammo
is
the
big
3
:
9mm
Luger
,
40
S
&
W
,
and
.
45
ACP
.
.
380
will
round
out
the
affected
semi
-
automatic
rounds
,
and
there
usually
is
a
bit
of
a
run
on
.
357
Magnum
and
.
38
Special
as
well
.
10mm
,
.
357
SIG
,
.
45
GAP
and
other
magnums
like
the
.
44
do
not
seem
to
be
affected
.
For
rimfires
,
.
22
Long
Rifle
just
goes
poof
,
while
its
Magnum
brother
and
smaller
,
17
caliber
,
cousins
do
not
seem
to
be
as
affected
.
Rimfires
are
not
reloadable
,
and
this
contributes
to
their
over
-
stockpiling
.
Components
and
Accessories
Most
centerfire
ammo
is
reloadable
,
and
the
serious
amongst
shooters
will
roll
their
own
for
economy
,
self
-
reliance
,
and
performance
,
so
the
consumable
components
will
also
get
some
panics
.
Although
I’ve
held
off
on
reloading
articles
until
I
get
my
press
set
back
up
,
we
can
hit
up
the
components
that
will
get
panic
bought
briefly
.

Biggest
thing
is
primers
,
even
bigger
than
the
bullets
,
oddly
enough
.
The
primer
is
the
little
metal
cup
that
gets
smacked
by
the
firing
pin
and
sets
off
the
powder
in
modern
cartridges
,
and
they
come
in
two
sizes
for
pistols
,
two
for
rifles
,
and
of
varying
hardness
to
satisfy
military
specifications
.
The
second
is
gunpowder
itself
.
Fortunately
,
there’s
a
wide
variety
of
smokeless
powder
,
and
everyone
tends
to
have
the
brands
and
formulas
they
prefer
,
so
it
takes
a
little
less
of
a
hit
than
the
primers
.
The
third
is
the
bullets
,
and
since
there
are
so
many
types
and
manufacturers
,
they
also
take
a
little
less
of
a
hit
than
primers
.
While
you
obviously
need
all
three
to
reload
,
bear
that
in
mind
.
Always
save
your
brass
,
and
anyone
else’s
you
can
pick
up
.
Even
though
the
little
ones
are
easier
to
use
,
the
higher
capacity
ones
disappear
first
.
Get
both
.
While
it
is
always
a
good
idea
to
have
spare
springs
and
small
parts
like
firing
pins
and
extractors
that
are
prone
to
breakage
,
the
number
one
accessory
or
part
to
take
a
hit
in
panics
is
the
box
magazine
,
especially
“
high
capacity
”
ones
.
I
don’t
mean
the
200
round
drum
mags
,
although
those
do
take
a
dive
,
nor
do
I
really
mean
the
100
round
coffin
mags
,
but
I
mean
the
full
capacity
full
sized
pistol
mags
,
like
a
15
round
mag
for
a
full
sized
pistol
,
or
a
30
round
AR
-
15
mag
.
Expect
to
see
P
-
mags
and
surplus
style
aluminum
AR
mags
just
vanish
.
The
Gabby
Giffords
Special
,
the
extended
Glock
17
30
round
mag
,
is
also
a
contender
for
vanishing
fast
in
a
panic
.
Holsters
,
slings
,
cleaning
accessories
,
optics
,
and
ammo
cans
seem
to
be
immune
from
panics
.
What
to
do
?
If
you
already
own
a
carbine
and/or
a
semi
-
auto
pistol
,
make
sure
you
have
enough
ammo
,
magazines
,
and
spare
parts
.
It’s
a
lot
better
to
have
one
gun
with
multiple
mags
and
a
lot
of
ammo
than
many
guns
with
the
one
or
two
mags
with
which
they
came
from
the
factory
and
a
couple
boxes
of
ammo
.
I
try
to
have
at
least
six
mags
for
my
semi
-
auto
pistols
,
and
at
least
ten
mags
for
my
semi
-
auto
rifles
.
Get
some
rifle
mags
of
different
sizes
,
the
30
and
40
AR
mags
are
fun
for
shooting
standing
up
,
but
they
get
in
the
way
of
prone
firing
and
the
10
and
20
rounders
are
preferable
.
Your
ultimate
ammo
goal
,
I
maintain
,
should
be
a
thousand
practice
rounds
and
500
defense
rounds
for
each
gun
you
have
,
but
,
in
a
pre
-
panic
or
panic
situation
,
just
get
what
you
can
at
a
normal
price
;
some
is
better
than
none
.
If
you’re
into
reloading
,
you
know
what
to
get
already
.
If
you
don’t
own
anything
,
and
want
to
soon
,
refer
to
some
pistol
articles
,
a
rifle
article
,
a
shotgun
article
,
and
a
buying
guide
here
.
Consider
buying
some
stripped
AR
lowers
to
build
on
a
rainy
day
later
on
.
Build
an
AR
and
meet
girls
at
the
range
?
Conclusion
No
matter
who
got
elected
,
I
think
this
country
is
in
for
rough
times
.
It’s
always
better
to
have
firearms
and
not
need
them
,
then
not
have
them
and
need
them
.
Store
yours
safely
,
but
accessible
and
ready
in
times
of
need
.
