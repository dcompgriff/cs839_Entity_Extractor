Leaked
audio
from
2006
,
when
Hillary
Clinton
was
running
for
<[>Senate<]>
in
New
York
,
proves
that
she
has
absolutely
NO
apprehensions
about
rigging
elections
.

During
an
editorial
meeting
with
a
small
Jewish
newspaper
in
Brooklyn
,
various
topics
were
discussed
,
including
the
then
-
recent
election
in
Palestine
.

Here’s
what
Hillary
had
to
say
about
it:

“I
do
not
think
we
should
have
pushed
for
an
election
in
the
Palestinian
territories
.
I
think
that
was
a
big
mistake
.
Â
And
if
we
were
going
to
push
for
an
election
,
then
we
should
have
made
sure
that
we
did
something
to
determine
who
was
going
to
win
.
