Locals
are
fuming
because
they
are
are
only
allowed
into
the
site
in
the
south-eastern
Europe
country
if
they
are
servants
or
cleaners.

The
complex
is
surrounded
by
heavy
security,
gates
and
high
walls
and
the
locals
think
it
is
unlawful
for
foreigners
to
buy
up
part
of
the
country
and
then
ban
them
from
entering.

Women
reportedly
bring
up
their
children
there
and
their
husbands
are
just
occasional
visitors.

Investors
from
the
Middle
East
built
the
160-home
luxury
estate
near
Tarcin,
which
is
close
to
the
Bosnian
capital
of
Sarajevo.

The
homes,
which
are
being
marketed
in
Kuwait,
are
being
sold
for
£133,000.

Adverts
for
the
homes
call
Bosnia
a
Muslim
country
“gifted
with
beautiful
nature
by
Allah”.

An
estate
agent
told
