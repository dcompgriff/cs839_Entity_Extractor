Forces
Still
Several
Kilometers
From
Mosul

Adding
to
the
upbeat
official
assessment
of
the
invasion
of
Mosul,
Centcom
chief
Gen.
Joseph
Votel
today
told
the
press
that
he
believes
the
forces
involved
have
“
probably
killed
about
800-900
ISIS
fighters
”
in
the
past
week
and
a
half.

By
contrast,
Votel
insisted
that
only
57
Iraqi
troops
were
killed,
and
another
30
Kurdish
Peshmerga.
Unmentioned
was
a
US
soldier
also
killed
in
the
fighting,
embedded
with
the
Peshmerga
and
killed
by
a
roadside
bomb
north
of
Mosul.

It
is
difficult
to
get
accurate
information
on
ISIS
casualties,
and
the
official
figures
from
Iraqi
officials
are
almost
always
dramatically
overstated
in
an
effort
to
sell
the
war
as
a
runaway
success.
There
are
reasons
to
be
skeptical
about
the
800-900
figure,
however.

The
main
reason
is
that
Iraqi
and
Kurdish
forces
are
still
several
kilomters
away
from
the
outskirts
of
Mosul,
mostly
occupying
empty
villages,
and
while
ISIS
has
sent
out
some
forces
of
skirmishers
to
slow
their
advance,
it
is
believed
the
vast
majority
of
their
defensive
forces
have
remained
in
Mosul,
gearing
up
for
the
eventual
attack
and
setting
assorted
traps.
