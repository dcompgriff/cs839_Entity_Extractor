The
conscious
and
intelligent
manipulation
of
the
organized
habits
and
opinions
of
the
masses
is
an
important
element
in
democratic
society
.
Those
who
manipulate
this
unseen
mechanism
of
society
constitute
an
invisible
government
which
is
the
true
ruling
power
of
our
country
.
We
are
governed
,
our
minds
are
molded
,
our
tastes
formed
,
our
ideas
suggested
,
largely
by
men
we
have
never
heard
of
.

Edward
Bernays
(
“the
father
of
public
relations”
)
,
Propaganda
,
1928
(
note
that
Bernays’
book
,
Propaganda
,
begins
with
the
above
quote
)
.


If
you
told
somebody
10
years
ago
that
there
existed
some
sort
of
secret
group
or
“secret
government”
pulling
the
strings
behind
the
scenes
of
government
policy
,
international
law
,
various
global
rules/regulations
,
and
more
,
they
would
have
called
you
a
“conspiracy
theorist
.
”
Today
things
have
changed
,
largely
as
a
result
of
information
leaked
by
Edward
Snowden
,
Julian
Assange
,
and
various
other
whistleblowers
and
activists
in
recent
years
.
Their
bravery
has
shed
light
on
the
world
of
secrecy
that’s
been
blinding
the
masses
since
its
inception
.
I’ve
mentioned
this
before
,
and
I’ll
mention
it
again
,
did
you
know
that
the
U
.
S
.
Government
classifies
more
than
500
million
pages
of
documents
each
year
?
Did
you
know
that
the
United
States
has
a
history
of
government
agencies
existing
in
secret
?
For
example
,
the
<[>National
Security
Agency<]>
(
<[>NSA<]>
)
was
founded
in
1952
,
but
its
existence
was
hidden
until
the
mid
1960’s
.
Even
more
secretive
is
the
<[>National
Reconnaissance
Office<]>
,
it
was
founded
in
1960
but
remained
completely
secret
for
30
years
.
Then
we
have
the
entire
black
budget
world
,
a
world
dominated
by
secrecy
that
was
officially
revealed
by
Edward
Snowden
a
couple
of
years
ago
.
This
deals
with
what
are
known
as
“Special
Access
Programs
.
”
It’s
not
just
statements
that
these
“high
-
level”
people
are
making
.
It’s
all
of
the
proof
and
evidence
that
goes
along
with
it
.

Canadian
Defence
Minister
Paul
Hellyer
Former
Minister
of
<[>National
Defence<]>
,
Paul
Hellyer
,
is
one
of
Canada’s
best
known
and
most
controversial
politicians
.
He
was
first
elected
in
1949
,
and
was
the
youngest
cabinet
minister
appointed
to
Louis
S
.
St
.
Laurent’s
government
eight
years
later
.
He
held
senior
posts
in
the
governments
of
Lester
B
.
Pearson
and
Pierre
E
.
Trudeau
.
He
achieved
the
rank
of
senior
master
(
Deputy
Prime
Minister
)
,
and
went
on
to
become
the
Canadian
Defence
Minister
.
He
is
best
known
for
the
unification
of
the
<[>Canadian
Armed
Forces<]>
,
and
in
September
2005
he
became
the
first
person
of
cabinet
rank
in
the
G8
group
of
countries
to
state
unequivocally
that
“UFOs
are
as
real
as
the
airplanes
flying
overhead
.
”


Here’s
what
he
had
to
say
about
the
world
of
secrecy:
It
is
ironic
that
the
U
.
S
.
would
begin
a
devastating
war
,
allegedly
in
search
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
,
when
the
most
worrisome
developments
in
this
field
are
occurring
in
your
own
backyard
.
It
is
ironic
that
the
U
.
S
.
should
be
fighting
monstrously
expensive
wars
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
,
allegedly
to
bring
democracy
to
those
countries
,
when
it
itself
can
no
longer
claim
to
be
called
a
democracy
,
when
trillions
,
and
I
mean
thousands
of
billions
of
dollars
have
been
spent
on
projects
about
which
both
the
Congress
and
the
Commander
in
Chief
have
been
kept
deliberately
in
the
dark
.

President
Woodrow
Wilson
Woodrow
Wilson
,
an
American
academic
,
politician
,
and
the
28th
president
of
the
United
States
,
had
this
to
say
(
among
other
things
)
in
his
book
The
New
Freedom
.
The
book
also
contains
several
other
,
similarly
eye
-
opening
statements:
Since
I
entered
politics
,
I
have
chiefly
had
men’s
views
confided
to
me
privately
.
Some
of
the
biggest
men
in
the
United
States
,
in
the
field
of
commerce
and
manufacture
,
are
afraid
of
somebody
,
are
afraid
of
something
.
They
know
that
there
is
a
power
somewhere
so
organized
,
so
subtle
,
so
watchful
,
so
interlocked
,
so
complete
,
so
pervasive
,
that
they
had
better
not
speak
above
their
breath
when
they
speak
in
condemnation
of
it
.

The
35th
U
.
S
.
President
John
F
.
Kennedy
Here’s
what
JFK
had
to
say
in
one
of
his
most
famous
speeches:
The
very
word
“secrecy”
is
repugnant
in
a
free
and
open
society
;
and
we
are
as
a
people
inherently
and
historically
opposed
to
secret
societies
,
to
secret
oaths
and
to
secret
proceedings
.
We
decided
long
ago
that
the
dangers
of
excessive
and
unwarranted
concealment
of
pertinent
facts
far
outweighed
the
dangers
which
are
cited
to
justify
it
.
Even
today
,
there
is
little
value
in
opposing
the
threat
of
a
closed
society
by
imitating
its
arbitrary
restrictions
.
Even
today
,
there
is
little
value
in
insuring
the
survival
of
our
nation
if
our
traditions
do
not
survive
with
it
.
And
there
is
very
grave
danger
that
an
announced
need
for
increased
security
will
be
seized
upon
by
those
anxious
to
expand
its
meaning
to
the
very
limits
of
official
censorship
and
concealment
.
That
I
do
not
intend
to
permit
to
the
extent
that
it
is
in
my
control
.
…
For
we
are
opposed
around
the
world
by
a
monolithic
and
ruthless
conspiracy
that
relies
primarily
on
covert
means
for
expanding
its
sphere
of
influence–on
infiltration
instead
of
invasion
,
on
subversion
instead
of
elections
,
on
intimidation
instead
of
free
choice
,
on
guerrillas
by
night
instead
of
armies
by
day
.
It
is
a
system
which
has
conscripted
vast
human
and
material
resources
into
the
building
of
a
tightly
knit
,
highly
efficient
machine
that
combines
military
,
diplomatic
,
intelligence
,
economic
,
scientific
and
political
operations
.
Its
preparations
are
concealed
,
not
published
.
Its
mistakes
are
buried
,
not
headlined
.
Its
dissenters
are
silenced
,
not
praised
.
No
expenditure
is
questioned
,
no
rumor
is
printed
,
no
secret
is
revealed

what
he

to

A

refuse

do

In

address

president
Eisenhower
offered
these
words
of
caution:
In
the
councils
of
government
,
we
must
guard
against
the
acquisition
of
unwarranted
influence
,
whether
sought
or
unsought
,
by

military
industrial
complex

The
potential
for
the
disastrous
rise
of
misplaced
power
exists
,
and
will
persist
.
…
Only
an
alert
and
knowledgeable
citizenry
can
compel
the
proper
meshing
of
the
huge
industrial
and
military
machinery
of
defence
with
our
peaceful
message
and
goals
