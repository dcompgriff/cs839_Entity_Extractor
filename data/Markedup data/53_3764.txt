Daniel
Greenfield,
a
Shillman
Journalism
Fellow
at
the
Freedom
Center,
is
a
New
York
writer
focusing
on
radical
Islam.

Once
upon
a
time,
fact-checking
meant
that
newspapers,
radio
stations
and
television
news
broadcasts
were
obligated
to
check
their
facts
before
broadcasting
or
publishing
them.
Some
newspapers
and
magazines
boasted
renowned
departments
filled
with
intellectuals
whose
restless
minds
roved
over
each
line
to
ensure
that
the
fewest
possible
errors
would
appear
under
that
publication’s
masthead.

But
fact-checking
of
the
media
by
itself
has
declined
almost
as
badly
as
the
Roman
Empire.
Errors
routinely
appear
under
storied
mastheads
followed
by
corrections
that
are
published
as
a
janitorial
duty.
There
is
very
little
concern
for
the
facts
even
among
the
great
names
of
publishing
and
broadcasting.

The
media
has
stopped
fact-checking
itself
and
it
now
uses
fact-checking
largely
to
refer
to
a
type
of
opinion
journalism
in
which
it
“checks
the
facts”
of
public
figures.
The
fall
of
fact-checking
within
the
media
has
paralleled
the
rise
of
fact
checking
by
the
media
of
its
political
opponents.
The
media
has
become
factless
even
as
it
deploys
a
term
that
once
meant
self-correction
to
instead
correct
others.

Fact
checks
once
meant
that
reporters
were
expected
to
be
accurate.
These
days
they’re
only
expected
to
be
politically
correct.
The
media
deploys
fact
checks
to
check
political
correctness,
not
facts.
Its
fact
checks
routinely
venture
into
areas
that
are
not
only
partisan,
but
subjective
matters
of
opinion.

Consider
Politico’s
often
mocked
“fact
check”
of
Donald
Trump
as
to
whether
ISIS
was
indeed
unbelievably
evil.
Under
a
banner
headline,
“Donald
Trump’s
Week
of
Misrepresentations,
Exaggerations
and
Half-Truths”,
it
zoomed
in
on
a
quote
from
his
Florida
rally.

“We’re
presiding
over
something
that
the
world
has
not
seen.
The
level
of
evil
is
unbelievable,”
Trump
had
said.

Politico
swooped
in
to
correct
the
candidate
with
its
fact
check.
“Judging
one
‘level
of
evil’
against
another
is
subjective,
but
other
groups
in
recent
history
have
without
any
question
engaged
in
as
widespread
killing
of
civilians
as
ISIS.”

There
were
no
facts
being
checked
here
because
Politico
doesn’t
seem
to
know
what
a
fact
even
is.

The
only
information
conveyed
by
this
“fact
check”
is
that
Politico,
like
the
rest
of
the
media,
does
not
like
Donald
Trump
and
would
find
a
way
to
argue
with
him
if
he
said
that
the
sky
was
blue.

In
the
Daily
Show
media
culture
where
overt
bias
and
trolling
are
virtues,
fact-checking
is
just
another
snotty
variety
of
editorializing
that
attempts
to
compensate
for
perceptions
of
bias
not
with
higher
ethical
and
factual
standards,
but
by
rebranding
its
editorials
as
fact
checks
to
gain
credibility.

The
ISIS
evil
“fact
check”
of
Trump
came
from
the
same
media
outlet
whose
White
House
reporter
decided
that
the
Wisconsin
flag,
which
carries
the
date
1848
to
mark
the
state’s
admission
to
the
Union,
was
“a
flag
for
the
local
union,
Wisconsin
1848”.
Politico
ran
an
entire
story
asserting
that
Obama
was
flying
a
labor
flag
to
oppose
Governor
Walker
because
its
reporter
couldn’t
process
basic
history.

This
is
what
happens
when
media
outlets
think
that
fact-checking
is
something
that
they
do
to
Republicans
rather
than
to
themselves.

Fact-checking
was
one
of
those
dinosaurs
of
journalism,
like
objectivity,
which
is
viewed
as
largely
irrelevant
in
a
media
culture
whose
Edward
R.
Murrow
is
Jon
Stewart.
Today’s
millennial
journalists
spend
most
of
their
time
exchanging
sarcastic
quips
with
their
peers
on
Twitter,
aspire
to
found
their
own
Vox
sites
and
write
viral
blog
posts
that
seek
a
new
angle
on
a
trending
left-wing
narrative.

Fact
checks
often
function
as
narrative
defenses
and
meme
attacks.
That’s
why
the
Washington
Post
decided
to
“fact
check”
a
Saturday
Night
Live
gag
about
Obama’s
illegal
alien
amnesty.
It’s
not
that
anyone
imagines
that
Saturday
Night
Live
is
in
the
business
of
producing
facts
that
need
checking.
The
Post
was
just
worried
that
one
of
its
jokes
would
go
viral
and
hurt
Obama
and
his
agenda.

It’s
the
same
reason
that
the
paper
“fact
checked”
a
13-year-old
boy
who
claimed
he
was
blocked
by
Obama
on
Twitter.
This
isn’t
about
the
facts.
It’s
paranoia
about
social
media
narratives
going
viral.

This
is
more
understandable
if
you
stop
thinking
of
the
media
in
the
old-fashioned
sense
as
a
series
of
papers,
radio
and
television
stations
and
start
thinking
of
it
as
a
massive
machine
that
advocates
for
left-wing
policies
using
its
massive
infrastructure
and
wealth
to
monopolize
internet
narratives.

Media
outlets
trade
on
their
history,
but
they
don’t
resemble
their
past
selves
in
any
meaningful
way.

The
New
Yorker
once
boasted
a
fact-checking
department
that
was
famous
for
its
range,
its
depth
and
its
resourcefulness
in
running
down
even
the
most
obscure
facts.
But
what
use
is
such
a
thing
at
David
Remnick’s
New
Yorker
whose
big
draw
comes
from
Andy
Borowitz’s
insipid
near
parodies?
The
New
Republic
went
from
respected
liberal
publication
to
another
snarky
and
shrill
social
justice
blog.
CBS
News
cited
a
psychic
site
to
explain
that
a
fly
landed
on
Hillary’s
face
to
help
her
cope
with
stress.

This
isn’t
material
that
exists
in
the
same
realm
as
facts.
It’s
snarky
contempt
alternating
with
lowest
common
denominator
propaganda.
Left-wing
journalism,
like
most
left-wing
culture,
is
totalitarian
anti-intellectualism
masquerading
as
enlightened
intellectualism.
The
Soviet
Union
was
quite
fond
of
culture.
It
just
hated
the
creative
process
that
produced
it
because
it
was
independent
of
Communist
ideology.
The
left
loves
journalism;
it
just
hates
the
objectivity
that
validates
journalism
as
more
than
propaganda.

It’s
this
perverse
anti-intellectualism
that
turned
fact-checking
from
self-discipline
to
attack
ad.
Once
journalism
became
pure
left-wing
advocacy,
it
also
became
inherently
correct
by
virtue
of
being
left-wing
and
was
not
in
need
of
having
its
facts
checked.
When
fact
checks
stopped
being
something
that
journalists
did
to
themselves,
first
facts
and
then
fact
checks
became
meaningless.
Unable
to
even
recognize
a
fact,
media
fact
checkers
just
wrote
editorials
which
spiced
their
left-wing
attacks
on
Republicans
liberally
with
cargo
cult
invocations
to
“fact”
as
if
it
were
some
deity.

The
average
media
fact
check
is
a
masterpiece
of
unintentional
comedy
for
thinking
adults.

At
the
Washington
Post
,
Michelle
Yee
“fact
checks”
Donald
Trump’s
comment
that
Hillary’s
email
scandal
is
bigger
than
Watergate
and
concludes
that
since
Watergate
led
to
Nixon’s
resignation
and
Hillary’s
email
scandal
has
yet
to
lead
to
any
convictions,
it
can’t
be
bigger
than
Watergate.
Since
the
scandal
has
yet
to
be
resolved,
a
fact
check
of
it
could
only
take
place
in
the
future.

CNN
featured
Toronto
Star
“fact
checker”
Daniel
Dale
who
claimed
that
Trump
said
35
lies
in
one
day.

The
list
of
“lies”
included
deeming
Trump’s
statement
that
Hillary
would
raise
taxes
false
because
her
plan
only
taxes
the
rich,
asserting
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
“phony
poll”
and
denying
that
Hillary
Clinton
had
received
debate
questions.
Some
of
these
“lies”
are
themselves
lies.
Others,
like
Yee,
show
an
inability
to
even
understand
what
a
fact
is
and
what
can
and
can’t
be
deemed
false.

Just
how
degraded
fact
checking
had
become
was
made
manifest
when
Hillary
Clinton
pleaded
at
the
debate,
“Please,
fact
checkers,
get
to
work.”
Her
campaign
site
touted
its
own
“fact
checking”
which
was
mostly
indistinguishable
from
the
media’s
fact
checking.
That
was
a
commentary
on
the
transformation
of
the
media
into
a
left-wing
politician’s
spin
center.

Nearly
every
media
outlet
now
boasts
a
fact
check
blog
or
headlines
touting
fact
checks.
But
the
biggest
fact
checking
department
of
the
media,
rather
than
by
the
media,
isn’t
in
the
United
States,
but
in
Germany.
In
America,
fact
checking
has
become
a
type
of
partisan
attack
launched
by
media
outlets
at
their
political
opponents.
It’s
bigger
than
ever
and
also
more
worthless
than
ever
because
it
is
factless.

And
those
who
do
it
often
not
only
don’t
know
the
facts,
but
don’t
even
know
what
a
fact
is.
