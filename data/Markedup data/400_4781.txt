One
argument
Trump
supporters
and
conservatives
are
making
is
that
there
has
been
a
lefward
shift
at
Fox
News
.

TrumpTV
@ShaneKPolitics
Breitbart

right
is
laying
the
groundwork
for
TrumpTV
so
naturally
they’re
throwing
FoxNews
under
the
bus
.

As
mentioned
in
a
recent
story
about
Megyn
Kelly
on
The
Wildfire
,
if
TrumpTV
becomes
a
reality
,
a
media
war
will
loom
over
who
is
the
real
“conservative”
leader
in
cable
news
.
Prepping
the
terrain
would
mean
starting
to
carve
out
a
hard
right
audience
and
yank
it
away
from
Fox
News
.

Ailes
Departure
Fox
News
‘Imploding’
probably
has
more
to
do
with
Roger
Ailes
leaving
than
Trump
.
It
was
founded
as
the
news
arm
of
the
GOP
.

Not

Since
Ailes
has
stepped
down
,
there
are
two
interim
co
-
presidents
at
Fox
News:
Bill
Shine
and
Jack
Aberneth
.
As
reported
by
The
Hollywood
Reporter
,
it
is
believed
by
some
that
CNN’s
Jeff
Zucker
could
be
in
line
to
fill
Ailes’
shoes
,
due
to
a
merger
between
AT
&
T
and
Time
Warner
.

Fox

Imploding
.
The
network
has
taken
a
left
turn
since
the
Murdoch
sons
took
the
reins
.

The
would

be
successors
to
the
Murdoch
empire
are
believed
to
be
much
less
conservative
than
their
father
Rupert
Murdoch

Like
Mainstream
Media
I’m
glad
to
see
Fox
News
imploding
.
It’s
almost
as
bad
as
the
rest
of
the
mainstream
media
.
Especially
Megyn
Kelly
.
Good
riddance
