Architecture
means
many
things
to
many
people:
It’s
a
form
of
creative
expression
,
a
tool
for
meticulous
construction
,
a
craft
,
a
profession
.
In
short
,
it’s
much
more
than
just
perfectly
placing
bricks
to
form
a
building
.
In
this
Ted
Talk
,
Michael
Murphy
discusses
how
his
father’s
brush
with
death
ultimately
opened
the
doors
to
his
own
life
path
of
architecture
,
but
not
just
as
a
profession
,
and
not
just
as
a
creative
expression
.
When
designing
,
Murphy
and
his
team
go
beyond
the
blueprint
,
considering
things
like
how
like
airflow
and
light
can
produce
both
a
healthy
community
and
gorgeous
structures
.
He
shows
us
his
projects
in
countries
like
Rwanda
and
Haiti
,
and
covers
his
plan
for
creating
The
Memorial
to
Peace
and
Justice
,
which
mainly
aims
to
heal
hearts
in
the
American
South
.
“
Why
was
it
that
the
best
architects
,
the
greatest
architecture
—
a
ll
beautiful
and
visionary
and
innovative
—
is
also
so
rare
,
and
seems
to
serve
so
very
few
?
And
more
to
the
point:
With
all
of
this
creative
talent
,
what
more
could
we
do
?
”
Murphy
poses
in
his
talk
.

He
broke
into
the
very
soul
of
his
work
when
he
came
to
the
realization
that
buildings
are
actually
making
people
sicker
.
“
In
this
hospital
in
South
Africa
,
patients
that
came
in
with
,
say
,
a
broken
leg
,
to
wait
in
this
unventilated
hallway
,
walked
out
with
a
multidrug
-
resistant
strand
of
tuberculosis
.
Simple
designs
for
infection
control
had
not
been
thought
about
,
and
people
had
died
because
of
it
.
”

With
the
revelation
that
hospitals
are
making
patients
sicker
,
he
thought
of
designing
one
that
flips
the
hallways
on
the
outside
,
allowing
people
to
walk
in
the
exterior
.
“
If
mechanical
systems
rarely
work
,
what
if
we
could
design
a
hospital
that
could
breathe
through
natural
ventilation
,
and
meanwhile
reduce
its
environmental
footprint
?
”
he
said
.

He
then
discussed
the
incredible
community
aspect
of
following
through
with
his
healing
niche
in
the
architecture
world
.
“
We
worked
with
Bruce
Nizeye
,
a
brilliant
engineer
,
and
he
thought
about
construction
differently
than
I
had
been
taught
in
school
.
When
we
had
to
excavate
this
enormous
hilltop
and
a
bulldozer
was
expensive
and
hard
to
get
to
site
,
Bruce
suggested
doing
it
by
hand
,
using
a
method
in
Rwanda
called
“Ubudehe
,
”
which
means
“community
works
for
the
community
.
”
Hundreds
of
people
came
with
shovels
and
hoes
,
and
we
excavated
that
hill
in
half
the
time
and
half
the
cost
of
that
bulldozer
.
Instead
of
importing
furniture
,
Bruce
started
a
guild
,
and
he
brought
in
master
carpenters
to
train
others
in
how
to
make
furniture
by
hand
.
And
on
this
job
site
,
15
years
after
the
Rwandan
genocide
,
Bruce
insisted
that
we
bring
on
labor
from
all
backgrounds
,
and
that
half
of
them
be
women
.
“

Ultimately
,
the
healing
journey
became
twofold
,
as
it
was
both
the
process
of
building
to
heal
as
well
as
allowing
an
entire
community
to
heal
.
“We
call
this
the
locally
fabricated
way
of
building
,
or
‘lo
-
fab
,
’
and
it
has
four
pillars:
hire
locally
,
source
regionally
,
train
where
you
can
and
most
importantly
,
think
about
every
design
decision
as
an
opportunity
to
invest
in
the
dignity
of
the
places
where
you
serve
.
Think
of
it
like
the
local
food
movement
,
but
for
architecture
.
And
we’re
convinced
that
this
way
of
building
can
be
replicated
across
the
world
,
and
change
the
way
we
talk
about
and
evaluate
architecture
,
”
he
explained
.

In
his
talk
,
Murphy
reveals
how
he
learned
that
architecture
is
more
than
what
it
seems
.
It
“can
be
a
transformative
engine
for
change
.
”

Perhaps
it
will
show
you
how
your
work
can
be
more
than
what
it
seems
,
too
