Today
a
legend
who
was
asked
by
the
Chinese
government
to
give
a
speech
to
government
officials
in
China,
spoke
with
King
World
News
about
the
bear
raid
taking
place
in
the
gold
and
silver
markets.

Eric
King:
“John,
we
are
seeing
another
raid
in
the
gold
and
silver
markets,
which
are
getting
hit
in
early
trading
—
your
thoughts.”

John
Ing:
“It’s
important,
Eric,
to
make
the
distinction
between
physical
gold
and
paper
gold.
Just
like
we
are
seeing
now,
from
time-to-time
the
paper
gold
market
swamps
the
physical
gold
market,
but
amazingly
the
physical
gold
market
seems
to
keep
edging
up
and
helping
the
longer-term
upward
trend
of
the
gold
price…
IMPORTANT:
To
hear
which
legend
just
spoke

$8,000
gold
and

coming
mania

silver,
and
mining

John
Ing
continues:
“Sure
we
get
these
high-frequency
trades
to
the
downside
every
now
and
then,
but
it’s
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
to
push
the
price
of
gold
lower.

Russia
Adding
To
Its
Gold
Hoard
What
we
are
seeing
is
steady
accumulation
of
physical
gold.
For
example,
recently
Russia
added
13
tonnes
of
gold
to
their
growing
hoard
in
the
month
of
September.
In
fact,
the
Russians
have
now
been
purchasing
gold
for
20
months
in
a
row.

China’s
Relentless
Gold
Demand
Continues
We
also
have
China,
who
continues
to
be
a
large
buyer.
In
fact,
imports
of
gold
were
up
9
percent
in
the
month
of
September.
Eric,
the
problem
is
that
everybody
tends
to
look
at
the
numbers
out
of
China
but
they
really
don’t
know
how
to
interpret
them.
As
an
example,
the
most
important
thing
in
the
recently
released
figures
is
the
fact
that
the
banks
in
China
across
the
board
continue
to
be
buyers
of
physical
gold.
This
data
is
supported
by
the
Shanghai
Gold
Exchange,
which
is
now
the
largest
physical
gold
market
in
the
world.

India’s
Gold
Demand
Soars
A
Staggering
25
Percent!
But
despite
the
shenanigans
in
the
paper
gold
market,
the
bears
are
pushing
against
the
seasonal
strength
of
India
and
Diwali.
In
fact,
India’s
physical
gold
demand
was
up
a
staggering
25
percent!
So
yes,
there
has
been
steady,
steady
physical
gold
demand.

Against
this
very
strong
physical
gold
backdrop
there
have
been
a
lot
fewer
physical
supplies
of
gold.
We
have
just
seen
in
the
last
quarter
that
there
were
mixed
results
for
the
producers.
We
have
seen
many
companies
encountering
production
problems.
That
tells
me
that
even
at
the
higher
price
of
gold,
some
of
these
mining
companies
are
still
having
difficulty.
This
negatively
affects
the
total
annual
gold
production.
In
fact,
next
year
I
am
looking
for
lower
production
from
a
lot
of
these
producers.
So
that
will
further
tighten
an
already
strained
physical
market.

Gold
Bears
May
Get
Torched
Here
In
closing,
keep
in
mind
what
I
said
in
my
latest
piece
(on
KWN),
that
we
will
see
an
overnight
$100
spike
in
the
price
of
gold
if
Donald
Trump
wins
the
election.
In
the
event
that
the
bears
are
caught
on
the
wrong
side
of
that
trade,
they
will
experience
tremendous
pain.”
