Tom,
from
Scotland,
has
lived
in
The
Netherlands
since
1972
and
has
a
Dutch
wife.
The
reporter
of
the
world
famous
weekly
newspaper
The
Posthoorn
(chosen
by
75%
of
their
readers
as
their
favorite
alternative
cat
litter)
heard
on
the
grapevine
that
Tom,
the
Netherlands'
first
Brexit
prepper,
was
very
sad.
It
was
time
to
find
out
how
bad
sad
Tom
was.

The
reporter
approaches
the
local
pub
of
Tom.
Ten
flat
beers
are
standing
outside
in
the
autumn
sun,
but
Tom
is
nowhere
to
be
seen.
His
wife
is
there
with
friends,
waving
her
sixth
Calvados:
"Sadly,
he
is
not
joining
us
today.
He
is
somewhere
inside,
doing
an
experiment,
ask
the
bar
personnel."
Igo
inside
greeted
by
personnel
who
call
me
'the
cat
litter
reporter'.
It
seems
Tom
is
in
the
beer
cellar
doing
an
experiment.
How
sad
can
you
get?

This
reporter
carefully
goes
down
in
the
beer
cellar,
as
it
is
very
dark.
A
lonely
candle
shows
Tom
sitting
on
the
floor
having
a
beer.
"It
is
S.A.D."
he
says
sadly.
Why
is
he
so
sad?
"Not
sad,
but
S.A.D."
Tom
says.
"It
is
'Seasonal
Affective
Disorder'.
I
have
to
get
used
that
in
winter
after
3.00
PM
there
is
no
daylight
in
Scotland.
You
know
in
your
head
it
is
midafternoon,
but
outside
it
is
already
very
dark.
You
want
to
go
home
and
watch
the
9
o'clock
news,
but
you
still
have
6
hours
to
go!
Why
the
Dracula
story
was
set
in
Transylvania
beats
me,
he
could
have
increased
his
evil
doings
between
3
AM
and
9
PM
tenfold
and
spent
less
time
in
his
coffin
here
in
Scotland.
And
what
are
the
chances
of
garlic
growing
in
these
short
days.
Now
I
have
to
take
vitamin
D
while
I
prefer
vitamin
B,
if
you
know
what
I
mean."

How
is
his
course
''to
Skype'
going?
Tom
looks
defiant:
"Not
very
good,
I
must
admit.
The
first
time
I
started
up
the
app
I
thought
it
was
an
app
for
a
mirror.
Handy.
I
could
see
my
nose
hairs
sticking
out;
I
got
the
scissors
out
and
clipped
them.
The
next
time
I
opened
the
app
I
could
see
my
hair
was
too
long,
so
I
went
to
the
hairdresser.
It
also
shows
up
every
wrinkle.
I
wonder
is
Skype
sponsored
by
Botox?
It
depresses
me.
Maybe
if
I
take
my
teeth
out
I
will
finally
make
a
successful
'duck
face',
which
seems
to
be
de
rigueur
these
days,
for
my
profile
photo."

The
reporter
invites
Tom
for
a
drink
in
the
bar.
A
bit
difficult
as
Tom
takes
a
beer
from
outside
and
they
are
already
paid
for.
"Sometimes
they
steal
one
of
my
beers,
how
much
worse
can
it
get.
I
do
not
prep
only
for
myself,
but
for
all
the
Brexit
preppers
out
there.
The
world
is
a
darker
place
these
days."
