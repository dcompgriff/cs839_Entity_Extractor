Rory
Hall
from
The
Daily
Coin
joined
Silver
Doctors.
Hall
believes
price
manipulators
are
losing
control
of
the
gold
and
silver
markets.

When
it
comes
to
investing
in
precious
metals,
Hall
says
“stay
away
from
paper…If
you
don’t
hold
it
you
don’t
own
it.”

Hall
also
discusses
how
China
accumulating
massive
amounts
of
gold.
What
do
they
plan
to
do
with
the
shiny
metal?
Hall
predicts
China
will
issue
some
sort
of
goldbacked
currency
or
bond.
How
will
a
competing
gold
backed
currency
impact
the
value
of
the
dollar?
“It’s
no
secret
the
dollar
is
on
its
way
out,”
he
says.

The
economy
is
not
on
the
road
to
recovery,
Hall
says.
The
Fed,
European
Central
Bank,
and
Bank
of
Japan
are
holding
together
a
failed
system
by
papering
over
the
cracks
in
the
system,
while
not
fixing
the
fundamental
problems.
Hall
believes
the
Powers
that
Be
cannot
hold
the
system
together
much
longer.

Stay
tuned
to
hear
Hall’s
opinion
on
how
to
prepare
for
the
coming
collapse!
