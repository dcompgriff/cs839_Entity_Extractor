Lindsay
Lohan’s
Strange
Accent:
Another
Telling
Sign

a
Mind

Slave
0

A
video
of
Lindsay
Lohan
giving
an
interview
with
a
strange
accent
has
lead
to
wild
speculation
from
fans
and
media.
However,
to
those
in
the
know,
this
is
yet
another
telling
symptom
of
MK
programming,
from
someone
who
has
already
displayed
many
other
symptoms.

There’s
a
difference
between
speaking
with
a
funny
accent
as
a
joke
and
speaking
with
a
completely
different
speech
pattern
in
all
seriousness.
One
is
the
result
of
goofing
around
and
the
other
is
the
result
an
alter-persona.

Lohan’s
new
accent
was
noticed
while
giving
an
interview
to
a
reporter
in
Greece.
Here’s
the
video.

Lindsay,
who
is
mainly
based
in
England
and
Greece
and
was
recently
in
a
relationship
with
a
Russian
billionaire
(MK
handler?),
was
explaining
to
the
journalist
about
why
she
has
opened
up
a
Nightclub
in
Athens
called
Lohan.
After
a
Daily
Mail
article
on
the
subject,
Lohan
“joked”
and
gave
her
accent
(and
alter-persona)
a
name:
Lilohan.

As
stated
in
previous
articles,
victims
of
Mind
Control
are
programmed
with
alter
personas
that
have
their
own
history,
identity
and
accent
(read
my
full
article
on
Monarch
Programming
here).
The
programming
is
so
pervasive
that
the
same
person
can
speak
different
languages
with
different
accents
effortlessly
–
while
the
core
persona
cannot.
For
this
reason,
the
spontaneous
yet
constant
usage
of
a
different
accent
is
one
of
the
main
tell-tale
signs
of
MK
programming.
And
Lindsay
Lohan
has
been
identified
her,
on
Vigilant
Citizen,
to
be
a
Beta
Kitten
slave
a
long
time
ago.
The
entertainment
industry
has
been
very
keen
on
proving
this
fact
through
symbolic
pictures.
Lindsay
posed
countless
times
as
Marilyn
Monroe
who
is
the
prototype
of
Beta
Kitten
Programming.
In
this
photo
by
Tyler
Shields,
Lindsay
lays
on
a
bed
while
men
get
undressed.
One
cannot
come
up
with
a
more
graphic
way
of
portraying
the
life
of
Beta
Kitten
slaves.
Industry
slaves
must
work
with
creepy
photographers
such
as
Terry
Richardson.
Bonus
industry
slave
sign:
One
Eye
sign.
In
another
shoot
with
Terry
Richardson,
Lohan
appears
genuinely
traumatized.

In
past
years,
Lohan
has
floated
in
and
out
of
rehab
(aka
re-programming)
while
increasingly
appearing
to
be
“out
of
it”.

Another
famous
person
who
has
been
displaying
the
same
Beta
Kitten
symptoms
is
Britney
Spears.
Here’s
an
article
about
her
speaking
with
a
different
accent
in
2008
–
around
the
time
of
her
infamous
head-shaving
meltdown.
Britney
Spears
Lapses
Into
a
British
Accent

Britney
Spears
has
a
new
accessory
to
go
with
her
pink
wig:
a
British
accent.

In
the
last
several
weeks,
Spears,
26,
has
been
videotaped
numerous
times
trading
her
Louisiana
twang
for
U.K.
inflections.

“She
had
the
English
accent
thing
going
the
whole
time”
while
shopping
at
Kitson
last
Thursday,
according
to
a
source.
“It
didn’t
stop.”

Even
when
angry,
the
accent
appears.
On
an
L.A.
shopping
trip
to
Macy’s
on
Jan.
13,
she
screamed
at
the
paparazzi,
“Get
out
of
my
G——
face!”
–
in
a
British
accent.

So
is
it
all
in
fun
or
has
she
flipped
her
pink
wig?

“When
someone
has
dissociative
identity
disorder”
–
formerly
known
as
multiple
personality
disorder
–
“each
identity
is
split
off
from
the
other,”
says
L.A.
psychologist
Renee
A.
Cohen,
who
is
not
treating
Spears.
“Each
identity
would
have
its
own
name,
memories,
behavioral
traits
and
emotional
characteristics.”

Cohen
says
the
critical
question
is:
“When
Britney
uses
the
British
accent,
or
appears
to
take
on
another
identity,
does
she
know
she’s
Britney
Spears?”

“Otherwise,
she
could
simply
be
behaving
this
way
for
attention,
for
sympathy,
or
any
other
reason,”
adds
Cohen.
“It’s
foolish
to
attempt
to
diagnose
her
without
a
formal
evaluation.”

One
possible
influence
could
be
Spears’s
maternal
grandmother,
Lilian
Bridges,
who
was
originally
from
England.

Also,
Spears’s
new
beau,
photographer
Adnan
Ghalib,
grew
up
in
Birmingham,
England.

According
to
paparazzi
who
trail
the
singer
around
the
clock,
one
thing
is
for
sure:
the
pink
wig
means
something’s
changing.

“When
she
puts
on
the
pink
wig,
you
just
know
something
crazy
is
about
to
happen,”
said
one
paparazzo.

While
media
is
wondering
what
kind
of
accent
Lindsay
was
speaking
with
(sounds
Greek
to
me),
we
should
rather
wonder:
Why
would
a
30
year
old
woman
speak,
in
all
seriousness,
with
a
strange
accent
and
a
completely
different
speech
pattern?
Most
of
the
time
it
is
the
result
of
a
multiple-personality
disorder
(MPD)
–
which
is
a
symptom
of
Monarch
mind
control.
It
is
there,
right
in
our
face,
but
very
few
are
actually
seeing
it.
