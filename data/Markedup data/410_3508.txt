Will
the
2016
election
be
rigged?

That
depends
on
what
the
definition
of
“is”
is
–
and
whether
or
not
you
count
blatant
media
bias,
operatives
and
instigators,
shady
quasi-voters,
bizarre
electronic
voting
“errors”
and
a
heavy-handed
advantage
in
the
electoral
college
and
the
shifting
demographics
of
a
socialist
state
that
promises
much
to
certain
groups.

With
the
GOP
leadership
turning
its
back
on
Trump,
and
the
Democratic
machine
dedicated
solely
to
providing
for
Her,
it
will
be
a
difficult
win
for
Trump,
despite
overwhelming
enthusiasm
at
rallies
across
the
entire
country
and
lop-sided
pro-Trump
crowds
that
literally
dwarf
pro-Hillary
gatherings
of
very
few.

But
as
most
everyone
knows
by
now,
it
isn’t
the
popular
vote
that
counts
–
but
only
the
delegates
awarded
state-by-state
to
the
electoral
college…
and
that
is
a
game
that
Hillary’s
operatives
are
very
good
at
playing.
Daily
News
Brief:
The
2016
Election
Is
In
The
Process
Of
Being
Stolen
With
Rigged
Voting
Machines

There
are
several
states
–
in
particular
–
that
are
being
surprisingly
maneuvered
for
her
advantage…
and
if
successful,
will
block
Trump
from
even
coming
close
the
presidency.
Texas
Could
Turn
“Blue”
For
the
First
Time
In
20
Years

This
is
the
big
enchilada,
so
to
speak.
For
the
first
time
in
many
decades,
Texas
is
in
play
for
Hillary
and
the
Democrats.
Texas
has
been
as
solidly
“red”
as
any
state
in
the
union,
but
2016
could
be
different.

With
38
electoral
votes,
the
Lone
Star
State
is
the
biggest
prize
on
the
map
next
to
California,
whose
55
electoral
votes
have
gone
to
the
Democrats
since
before
history
began.
Since
at
least
2008,
the
Dems
have
been
massaging
their
electioneering
strategy
to
capitalize
on
shifting
demographics
–
with
plenty
of
Hispanics
in
the
next
generation
of
voters.
On
paper,
Hillary
should
be
able
to
play
well
to
Hispanics
with
all
the
controversy
over
Trump’s
immigration
stances
and
talk
of
a
border
wall.
Rumors
of
illegal
immigrants
be
encouraged
to
vote
could
be
a
crucial
factor,
with
polls
in
Texas
close
to
neck
and
neck…
it
could
go
either
way.

Of
course,
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
Team
Hillary
is
not
taking
any
chances.

As
Michael
Snyder
and
many
others
have
reported
,
electronic
voting
machines
have
been
mysteriously
flipping
votes
for
Hillary
in
several
counties
in
Texas…
and
that
doesn’t
bode
well
for
a
massive
electoral
prize
that
is
within
range
for
her
campaign:

Early
voting
has
already
begun
in
many
states,
and
a
number
of
voters
in
Texas
are
reporting
that
the
voting
machines
switched
their
votes
from
Donald
Trump
to
Hillary
Clinton.
The
odd
thing
is
that
none
of
the
other
choices
were
affected
when
these
individuals
attempted
to
vote
for
a
straight
Republican
ticket.
If
Hillary
Clinton
is
declared
the
winner
of
the
state
of
Texas
on
election
night,
a
full
investigation
of
these
voting
machines
should
be
conducted,
because
there
is
no
way
that
Donald
Trump
should
lose
that
state.
I
have
said
that
it
will
be
the
greatest
miracle
in
U.S.
political
history
if
Donald
Trump
wins
this
election,
but
without
the
state
of
Texas
Donald
Trump
has
exactly
zero
chance
of
winning.

At
least
one
county
is
making
an
emergency
switch
to
paper
ballots
after
irregularities
were
found
with
the
electronic
machines
during
early
voting.

Meanwhile,
Infowars
confronted
the
head
of
Texas’
elections
about
his
decision
to
violate
voter
laws
and
abandon
a
manual
count
of
a
random
sampling
of
1-3%
of
votes
(which
should
theoretically
reflect
the
larger
voting
trend,
unless
something
is
fishy).
Without
that
count,
there
is
less
accountability
than
ever:

This
is
major
issue,
and
Texas
isn’t
the
only
state…
just
the
biggest.

2.
Utah’s
Independent
Republican
Could
Actually
Beat
Trump

OK,
so
Utah
only
has
a
grand
total
of
6
electoral
college
votes…
and
has
never
been
a
decisive
swing
state
in
a
presidential
election.
But
that
is
because
the
state
has
been
so
solidly
“red.”
However,
this
election
is
totally
different.

A
little
known
independent
candidate
named
Evan
McMullin
has
actually
taken
the
lead
in
several
recent
polls
in
Utah,
and
is
neck-and-neck
with
both
Trump
and
Hillary
in
several
other
polls
(at
or
around
30%
apiece).
Libertarian
Gary
Johnson
is
also
playing
(relatively)
well
at
about
5%
–
possibly
enough
to
swing
further
momentum
away
form
Trump.

But
Evan
McMullin
is
the
real
surprise
hit
–
in
a
state
that
is
suddenly
considered
an
important
battleground
in
the
election.

McMullin
is
a
Mormon,
which
gives
him
a
significant
boost.
He
is
officially
tied
to
Better
for
America,
which
is
basically
a
#NeverTrump
operation
–
backed
by
neocons
like
William
Kristol.
Perhaps
unsurprisingly,
Evan
McMullin
has
a
pretty
colorful
and
telling
background
:
on
top
of
being
a
former
policy
director
for
House
Republicans,
he’s
also
a
former
CIA
operations
officer;
a
member
of
the
elite
think
tank
Council
on
Foreign
Relations
(CFR);
a
former
Goldman
Sachs
investment
banker
and
a
volunteer
refugee
resettlement
officer
for
the
United
Nations
High
Commissioner
for
Refugees
in
Jordan.

Wow!
I
wonder
if
there
could
be
an
agenda
there.
Hillary
probably
won’t
win
Utah,
but
Trump
may
not
either
–
and
it
could
make
a
crucial
difference
if
he
is
within
striking
distance
of
270
electoral
votes.

3.
Florida
Is
a
Must
Win
Swing
State
for
Trump…
But
Current
Polls
Show
Possible
Hillary
Win

Oh
boy…
Florida
all
over
again.
With
29
electoral
votes,
it
remains
a
major
contender
that
is
so
often
on
the
fence
and
swinging
in
the
wind.
It
is
considered
essential
for
a
Trump
victory,
and
indeed
for
just
about
any
successful
Republican
bid
for
the
presidency.

Sure,
we
all
know
the
polls
are
rigged,
and
may
be
oversampling
Dems
to
look
better
for
Hillary
on
paper
–
but
nonetheless,
that
perception
drives
expectations.

If
She
can
create
a
convincing
win
there,
it
could
change
the
course
of
the
election
once
again.
Florida
has
consistently
been
the
closest
outcome
–
in
2008
and
2012
it
went
blue
for
Obama;
in
2000
and
2004
it
went
red
for
Bush
(and
not
without
major
controversy
and
some
very
shady
recounting).

Her
team
is
pushing
heavily
for
early
voting
in
Florida,
and
so
far
they
claim
an
early
voting
advantage.

But
campaign
surrogate
Roger
Stone
is
now
reporting
that
Hillary
has
met
secretly
with
Broward
County
officials
in
Florida,
and
there
is
speculation
that
problems
with
the
voting
machines
may
soon
be
happening
all
over
again.

Pay
very
close
to
what
happens
there,
because
of
course,
Florida
could
be
THE
deciding
state
(again).
Right
now
polls
are
within
2
points
,
currently
in
favor
of
Trump
by
a
very
narrow
margin.

Colorado
Has
Known
Voting
Fraud
Issues
–
With
Dead
People
on
the
Voter
Rolls

With
9
electoral
votes,
Colorado
is
currently
swinging
“blue”
but
could
go
either
way.
CBS4
and
the
Washington
Times
reported
that
an
investigation
was
started
by
Colorado’s
Secretary
of
State
after
multiple
examples
were
found
of
deceased
people
registered
and
in
the
voter
rolls:

“This
is
the
kind
of
thing
you
hear
rumored,
joked
about
in
Chicago,
that
kind
of
thing,”
Mr.
Maasssaid
during
a
Thursday
evening
broadcast.
“Tonight,
that
changes.
We
did
find
voter
fraud
in
Colorado
that
essentially
waters
down
your
vote.”

It’s
not

whether
or
not
Colorado
could
make
a
difference
in
the
outcome,
but
the
results
could
prove
suspect.

Hillary
Is
“Leading”
In
These
Key
Swing
States

While
Trump
is
expected
to
win
the
crucial
state
of
Ohio,
and
also
North
Carolina,
Hillary
is
projected
to
take
key
states
including
Pennsylvania,
Colorado,
Iowa,
Virginia
and
Arizona.

According
to
the
Washington
Post
:

if
Clinton
can
hold
Virginia,
Pennsylvania,
and
Colorado,
then
she
only
needs
one
more
out
of
many
swing
states
—
New
Hampshire,
Nevada,
Ohio,
Iowa,
North
Carolina,
or
Florida
—
barring
any
surprise
Trump
win
in
a
blue-leaning
state
like
Wisconsin.
That
is
currently
looking
very
plausible.

While
any
of
these
could
change
in
the
actual
outcome,
it
shows
that
Hillary
has
definitely
maneuvered
to
win
where
it
counts
–
not
with
the
people,
but
with
the
electoral
college.

The
details
are
too
numerous
to
follow
here,
and
anything
could
happen.

You
Know
Voter
Fraud
Is
Happening
If
the
Media
Claim
It
Isn’t

What
should
be
very
telling
to
everyone
is
how
loudly
the
major
media
–
in
concert
–
are
trying
to
debunk
Trump’s
claims
of
voter
fraud
and
insist
that
all
is
well
when
it
is
quite
clear
that
there
are
major
issues.

This
is
one
claim
that
the
system
is
very
afraid
of,
because
quite
frankly,
they
have
a
great
deal
to
hide.

There
is
more
reason
than
ever
for
accountability,
reporting
on
any
irregularities
and
an
insistence
that
the
will
of
the
people
be
respected
–
because
the
system
is
desperate
to
hold
onto
control
at
any
cost.
