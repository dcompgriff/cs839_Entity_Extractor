DOJ:
Comey
NOT
ordered
to
withhold
discovery

U.S.
Attorney
General
Loretta
Lynch
leaves
after
attending
the
64th
Annual
Red
Mass
at
the
Cathedral
of
St.
Matthew
the
Apostle
in
Washington,
U.S.,
October
2,
2016.

Contrary
to
initial
reports,
U.S.
Attorney
General
Loretta
Lynch
did
not
order
FBI
Director
James
Comey
to
withhold
from
Congress
the
discovery
of
emails.

Attorney
General
Loretta
Lynch
did
not
order
Comey
to
withhold
information
of
new
investigation
into
emails
in
Hillary
Clinton's
email
server,
but
she
made
it
known
that
she
thought
his
decision
violated
department
policy.

Comey's
letter
on
Friday
notifying
members
of
Congress
that
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
had
discovered
new
emails
apparently
pertinent
to
the
Clinton
server
probe
has
upended
the
presidential
race
and
given
new
hope
to
Republican
candidate
Donald
Trump
that
he
can
make
a
comeback
and
win
on
Nov.
8.
Although
some
polls
prior
to
the
release
of
Comey's
letter
to
Congress
showed
that
support
for
Trump
was
already
back
on
the
rise.

Lynch's
office
informed
the
FBI
on
Thursday
that
sending
the
letter
conflicted
with
a
memo
containing
official
guidance
that
is
sent
to
all
Justice
Department
employees
during
presidential
election
years,
according
to
the
official.

The
memo
instructs
employees
to
"never
select
the
timing
of
investigative
steps...
for
the
purpose
of
affecting
any
election."

Senator
Harry
Reid,
the
Democratic
leader
in
the
Senate,
sent
Comey
a
letter
on
Monday
accusing
the
FBI
of
keeping
“explosive
information”
under
wraps
about
ties
between
the
Trump
campaign
and
Russian
officials.
