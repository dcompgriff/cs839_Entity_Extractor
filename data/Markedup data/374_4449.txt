On
October
27,
2016,
the
United
Nations
Committee
For
Nuclear
Disarmament
voted
in
favor
of
a
resolution
to
begin
negotiations
on
a
treaty
in
2017
which
will
aim
to
outlaw
destructive(fission)
nuclear
weapons.
123
voted
in
favor
of
the
resolution,
which
was
created
by
Austria,
Brazil,
South
Africa,
Ireland,
Mexico
and
Nigeria,
while
38
voted
against
and
16
abstained
from
voting
either
way.Not
surprisingly,
four
of
the
five
big
UN
Security
Council
nuclear
powers
voted
against
the
resolution,
which
included
France,
U.S.
Britain
and
Russia.
The
fifth
country,
China,
abstained
from
the
vote.
123
countries
voted
in
favor
of
the
resolution.
Ref.
Interestingly,
Japan
voted
against
the
resolution,
even
though
nuclear
fission
bombs
were
dropped
on
Hiroshima
and
Nagasaki
many
years
ago.In
a
very
surprising
move,
North
Korea
voted
in
favor
of
the
disarmament
resolution
and
said
they
will
bring
in
a,
“legally
binding
instrument
to
prohibit
nuclear
weapons,
leading
towards
their
total
elimination.”
Kate
Hudson,
who
is
the
Chair
for
the
Campaign
for
Nuclear
Disarmament
said
:
“It’s
very
encouraging
to
see
so
many
countries
say
loud
and
clear
it’s
time
for
the
world
to
move
on
from
nuclear
weapons.
We
have
united
before
to
ban
biological
and
chemical
weapons,
landmines
and
cluster
bombs,
and
now
the
international
community
is
taking
decisive
steps
to
ban
nuclear
weapons.”
The
world
wants
peace.
Ref.
In
addition
to
the
U.N.
vote,
the
European
Parliament
adopted
it’s
own
resolution
which
was
supported
by
415
votes,
opposed
by
124
and
74
chose
not
to
vote.
This
is
another
positive
step
forward
as
the
European
nations
can
help
to
add
great
weight
to
a
resolution
to
finally
disarm
the
world
of
destructive
nuclear
weapons.The
resolution
will
be
put
forth
to
the
UN
General
Assembly
in
December
and
is
now
likely
to
pass,
which
will
then
pave
the
way
for
further
negotiations
to
take
place
in
March,
June
and
July
of
2017.Beatrice
Fihn,
executive
director
of
the
International
Campaign
to
Abolish
Nuclear
Weapons,
described
the
vote
as
a
“historic
moment”
in
the
decades-long
drive
for
a
nuclear-free
world.
“This
treaty
won’t
eliminate
nuclear
weapons
overnight.
But
it
will
establish
a
powerful,
new
international
legal
standard,
stigmatizing
nuclear
weapons
and
compelling
nations
to
take
urgent
action
on
disarmament.”
Fission
vs.
Fusion
It
must
be
remembered
though
that
there
are
differences
when
someone
says
or
writes
“nuclear
energy.”
Nuclear
fission
is
the
destructive
kind.
It’s
the
kind
that
was
used
for
the
atomic
bombs
in
Japan.
Nuclean
fusion
is
harmless,
clean
and
can
produce
what
is
known
as
“free
energy.”According
to
Duke
Energy
:Both
fission
and
fusion
are
nuclear
reactions
that
produce
energy,
but
the
applications
are
not
the
same.Fission
is
the
splitting
of
a
heavy,
unstable
nucleus
into
two
lighter
nuclei,
and
fusion
is
the
process
where
two
light
nuclei
combine
together
releasing
vast
amounts
of
energy.For
example,
the
Sun
is
a
massive
producer
of
nuclear
fusion
energy,
which
is
what
scientists
are
working
on
to
try
and
create
“free
energy.”The
world
must
push
for
the
disarmament
of
nuclear
fission
technology
and
must
simultaneously
push
for
the
advancement
of
nuclear
fusion
technology.
The
world
is
moving
in
a
peaceful
direction
and
this
is
further
evidence
of
such
claims.
What
do
you
think
will
happen
in
2017
with
these
negotiations?
