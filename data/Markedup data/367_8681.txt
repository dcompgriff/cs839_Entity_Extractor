It
still
ain’t
over…
It
now
appears
that
John
Podesta
and
teams
of
voting
rights
lawyers
are
combing
over
Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin
and
Michigan
election
results
with
a
fine-toothed
comb,
county-by-county
and
are
now
suggesting
possible
vote
fraud
via
“irregularities.”
These
are
the
three
rust
belt
states
that
traditionally
swing
blue,
but
went
red
for
Trump
in
2016,
perhaps
in
large
part
due
to
his
message
on
economy
on
jobs.
It
remains
to
be
seen
whether
or
not
the
Clinton
Team
will
officially
challenge
these
results
or
demand
a
recount,
but
it
is
clear
that
many
of
Clinton’s
fiercest
establishment
allies
will
not
be
lying
down.
via
MSN.com
:
Hillary
Clinton
is
being
urged
by
a
group
of
prominent
computer
scientists
and
election
lawyers
to
call
for
a
recount
in
three
swing
states
won
by
Donald
Trump,
New
York
has
learned.
The
group,
which
includes
voting-rights
attorney
John
Bonifaz
and
J.
Alex
Halderman,
the
director
of
the
University
of
Michigan
Center
for
Computer
Security
and
Society
,
believes
they’ve
found
persuasive
evidence
that
results
in
Wisconsin,
Michigan,
and
Pennsylvania
may
have
been
manipulated
or
hacked.
The
group
is
so
far
not
speaking
on
the
record
about
their
findings
and
is
focused
on
lobbying
the
Clinton
team
in
private.
Last
Thursday,
the
activists
held
a
conference
call
with
Clinton
campaign
chairman
John
Podesta
and
campaign
general
counsel
Marc
Elias
to
make
their
case,
according
to
a
source
briefed
on
the
call.
The
academics
presented
findings
showing
that
in
Wisconsin,
Clinton
received
7
percent
fewer
votes
in
counties
that
relied
on
electronic-voting
machines
compared
with
counties
that
used
optical
scanners
and
paper
ballots.
Based
on
this
statistical
analysis,
Clinton
may
have
been
denied
as
many
as
30,000
votes;
she
lost
Wisconsin
by
27,000.
While
it’s
important
to
note
the
group
has
not
found
proof
of
hacking
or
manipulation,
they
are
arguing
to
the
campaign
that
the
suspicious
pattern
merits
an
independent
review
—
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
Obama
White
House
has
accused
the
Russian
government
of
hacking
the
Democratic
National
Committee.
Theoretically,
if
all
three
of
these
states
were
declared
for
Hillary
rather
than
for
Trump,
it
would
swing
the
electoral
college
count
towards
another
Clinton
presidency.

If
that
won’t
work,
there
are
still
electors
out
there
who
may
dissent
when
casting
their
electoral
college
ballots
by
mail
before
December
19th.
Some
people
never
quit.
It’s
hard
to
believe,
but
there
remains
an
outside
chance
that
the
election
is
still
up
in
the
air
–
at
least
in
the
minds
of
her
angry
and
disillusioned
staffers,
donors
and
supporters.
