Given
without
Consent

of

Year

mother
Sarah

The
VAXXED
film
crew
continues
interviewing
people
who
are
vaccine
damaged
around
the
country.

In
this
interview
in
Nebraska,
14
year
old
Savannah
Snyder
is
interviewed
along
with
her
mother
Sarah.

Savannah
talks
about
her
experiences
in
receiving
her
7th
grade
required
vaccines.
Her
mother
Sarah
explains
that
she
only
gave
permission
for
Savannah
to
receive
the
required
vaccines.
Gardasil,
the
HPV
vaccine,
is
an
optional
vaccine.
Sarah
explains
that
she
had
been
warned
about
this
vaccine
and
wanted
to
investigate
it
further.

You
believe
your
doctor.
Every
parent
believes
their
doctor.
We’re
all
trying
to
do
the
right
thing.

But
Savannah
was
given
the
Gardasil
vaccine
anyway,
without
their
original
knowledge.
She
immediately
started
suffering
some
side
effects,
such
as
a
headache,
almost
fainting,
and
skin
rashes
breaking
out.
She
soon
developed
pneumonia
and
other
infections.

As
time
went
on,
things
got
worse.
She
started
experiencing
seizures,
including
grand
mal
seizures.
She
was
hospitalized
many
times
for
severe
pain.
Her
mother
tearfully
explains
that
Savannah
would
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
state
that
she
was
dying.

Like
many
other
parents
of
children
with
Gardasil
injuries,
Sarah
relates
how
they
had
little
support,
and
that
most
people
just
thought
it
was
all
in
Savannah’s
head.

But
after
a
trip
to
the
Mayo
clinic,
Savannah
was
diagnosed
with
POTS
(postural
orthostatic
tachycardia
syndrome),
a
known
side
effect
of
Gardasil
that
affects
the
heart.

Comments
on
New
Study
Linking
HPV
Vaccines
to
POTS
)

Savannah
explains
that
before
the
Gardasil
shot,
she
was
very
active
and
athletic.
She
was
in
the
process
of
joining
a
gym.
Now,
she
has
difficulties
speaking
and
walking,
and
needs
a
feeding
tube.

Should
Their
Views
be
Silenced?

One
of
the
biggest
myths
being
propagated
in
the
compliant
mainstream
media
today
is
that
doctors
are
either
pro-vaccine
or
anti-vaccine,
and
that
the
anti-vaccine
doctors
are
all
“quacks.”

However,
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
in
the
vaccine
debate.
Doctors
are
not
unified
at
all
on
their
positions
regarding
“the
science”
of
vaccines,
nor
are
they
unified
in
the
position
of
removing
informed
consent
to
a
medical
procedure
like
vaccines.

The
two
most
extreme
positions
are
those
doctors
who
are
100%
against
vaccines
and
do
not
administer
them
at
all,
and
those
doctors
that
believe
that
ALL
vaccines
are
safe
and
effective
for
ALL
people,
ALL
the
time,
by
force
if
necessary.

Very
few
doctors
fall
into
either
of
these
two
extremist
positions,
and
yet
it
is
the
extreme
pro-vaccine
position
that
is
presented
by
the
U.S.
Government
and
mainstream
media
as
being
the
dominant
position
of
the
medical
field.

In
between
these
two
extreme
views,
however,
is
where
the
vast
majority
of
doctors
practicing
today
would
probably
categorize
their
position.
Many
doctors
who
consider
themselves
“pro-vaccine,”
for
example,
do
not
believe
that
every
single
vaccine
is
appropriate
for
every
single
individual.

Many
doctors
recommend
a
“delayed”
vaccine
schedule
for
some
patients,
and
not
always
the
recommended
one-size-fits-all
CDC
childhood
schedule.
Other
doctors
choose
to
recommend
vaccines
based
on
the
actual
science
and
merit
of
each
vaccine,
recommending
some,
while
determining
that
others
are
not
worth
the
risk
for
children,
such
as
the
suspect
seasonal
flu
shot.

These
doctors
who
do
not
hold
extreme
positions
would
be
opposed
to
government-mandated
vaccinations
and
the
removal
of
all
parental
exemptions.

In
this
eBook,
I
am
going
to
summarize
the
many
doctors
today
who
do
not
take
the
most
extremist
pro-vaccine
position,
which
is
probably
not
held
by
very
many
doctors
at
all,
in
spite
of
what
the
pharmaceutical
industry,
the
federal
government,
and
the
mainstream
media
would
like
the
public
to
believe.
