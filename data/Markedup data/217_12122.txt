Scientist
and
scholar
Frank
Legge
passed
away
on
October
20
th
2016
.
Frank
was
a
leader
of
the
<[>international
9/11
Truth<]>
Movement
.
He
had
been
a
co
-
editor
of
the
<[>Journal
of
9/11
Studies<]>
and
a
founding
member
of
both
<[>Scholars
for
9/11
Truth<]>
&
<[>Justice
and
Scientists
for
9/11
Truth<]>
.
His
contributions
to
research
into
9/11
will
be
remembered
as
among
the
most
important
in
history
.

Frank
had
a
long
and
fulfilling
life
before
and
beyond
the
events
of
9/11
.
He
was
a
husband
,
father
,
and
grandfather
as
well
as
a
farmer
,
pilot
,
research
scientist
,
and
entrepreneur
.

After
obtaining
a
Diploma
of
Agriculture
(
Longerenong
,
Victoria
,
Australia
)
,
Frank
spent
his
early
years
as
an
agricultural
employee
,
then
a
contractor
,
in
the
state
of
Queensland
.
He
then
obtained
a
“conditional
purchase”
block
of
virgin
bush
in
Western
Australia
,
which
he
cleared
and
developed
as
a
sheep
and
grain
farm
.
On
completion
of
this
,
Frank
moved
to
Perth
and
enrolled
at
the
<[>University
of
Western
Australia<]>
.
During
this
period
he
obtained
a
pilot’s
license
and
acquired
a
share
in
a
plane
,
which
was
useful
in
enabling
him
to
easily
visit
and
continue
operating
the
farm
.

On
graduating
with
a
Ph
.
D
.
in
chemistry
,
in
1983
,
Dr
.
Legge
worked
as
a
research
officer
for
the
<[>Department
of
Agriculture<]>
for
a
number
of
years
.
This
included
research
into
the
manufacture
and
use
of
biodiesel
.
He
was
also
involved
with
the
<[>Australian
Merino
Society<]>
in
the
development
of
their
sheep
-
breeding
index
.
With
a
colleague
,
he
then
formed
a
company
,
<[>Solar
Track
Pty
Ltd<]>
,
and
embarked
on
a
project
manufacturing
solar
tracking
devices
,
based
on
a
patented
concept
they
developed
in
conjunction
with
the
<[>Department
of
Agriculture<]>
.
Lastly
he
moved
to
consulting
.

Frank’s
understanding
of
the
events
of
9/11
was
set
out
in
his
website
,
now
maintained
by
David
Chandler
.
http://www
.
scienceof911
.
com
.

This
site
includes
links
to
many
papers
on
the
subject
,
including
those
Dr
.
Legge
wrote
and
co
-
authored
.
He
believed
that
the
evidence
for
explosives
in
controlled
demolition
of
all
three
of
the
buildings
at
the
World
Trade
Center
was
convincing
and
that
the
failure
of
the
<[>U
.
S
.
agency
NIST<]>
to
consider
this
possibility
was
prima
facie
evidence
of
corruption
and
obstruction
of
justice
.

Some
of
Dr
.
Legge’s
most
important
contributions
to
the
9/11
debate:
He
was
a
prolific
contributor
to
the
Journal
of
9/11
Studies
,
starting
with
the
first
publication
in
June
2006
.
His
careful
,
logical
approach
was
the
basis
for
a
dozen
articles
and
half
a
dozen
letters
published
by
the
Journal
.
In
October
2007
,
he
joined
as
co
-
editor
and
continued
in
that
capacity
until
July
2012
.
Among
his
most
important
articles
was
an
early
examination
of
the
fall
of
WTC
Building
7
in
which
Dr
.
Legge
examined
video
and
graphed
the
acceleration
of
the
building
.
This
paper
,
published
ten
years
ago
,
initiated
a
series
of
similar
calculations
that
led
to
irrefutable
arguments
in
favor
of
demolition
.
Dr
.
Legge’s
insights
and
expertise
were
often
less
visible
than
the
work
of
his
colleagues
.
That
fact
is
exemplified
by
his
listing
as
fourth
author
of
eight
on
the
seminal
article
Extremely
High
Temperatures
During
the
World
Trade
Center
Destruction
.
His
co
-
authors
would
agree
that
his
leadership
on
the
article
was
invaluable
.
He
was
co
-
author
for
articles
that
brought
the
unanswered
questions
of
9/11
into
mainstream
scientific
discussion
.
These
included
a
search
for
common
ground
with
official
investigators
called
Fourteen
Points
of
Agreement
with
Official
Government
Reports
on
the
Destruction
of
the
World
Trade
Center
.
Frank
was
also
an
important
contributor
to
the
breakthrough
article
entitled
Active
Thermitic
Material
Discovered
in
Dust
from
the
9/11
World
Trade
Center
Catastrophe
.
Collaborating
with
Warren
Stutt
,
Dr
.
Legge
provided
a
study
of
the
data
file
from
the
Flight
Data
Recorder
(
FDR
)
for
the
flight
that
was
reported
to
have
hit
the
Pentagon
.
The
purpose
of
this
work
was
to
show
that
,
contrary
to
widespread
belief
among
activists
,
the
data
portrayed
a
flight
that
corresponded
with
the
official
reports
of
the
course
of
the
aircraft
.
Frank’s
position
was
that
there
were
many
reasons
to
doubt
the
truthfulness
of
the
9/11
reports
but
the
data
from
the
FDR
was
not
one
of
them
.
His
hope
was
that
this
information
would
help
to
unify
the
<[>Truth
Movement<]>
as
it
would
reduce
the
tendency
to
assert
claims
,
based
on
misinterpretation
of
the
FDR
file
,
that
the
plane
did
not
hit
the
<[>Pentagon<]>
.
As
co
-
author
with
David
Chandler
,
Legge
examined
the
case
that
the
<[>Pentagon<]>
was
hit
by
a
plane
,
and
that
it
did
not
fly
over
,
as
asserted
by
some
activists
.
Again
Dr
.
Legge’s
hope
was
to
unify
the
<[>Truth
Movement<]>
.
This
was
followed
by
an
Addendum
that
strengthened
the
case
.

Although
a
sound
scientific
approach
was
characteristic
of
his
work
,
Legge’s
personality
was
also
important
in
that
he
was
often
the
most
mature
participant
in
any
discussion
.
This
is
not
to
say
he
was
merely
the
oldest
but
that
he
was
levelheaded
and
composed
in
many
heated
,
ego
-
driven
,
arguments
.
That
is
,
Frank
Legge
was
the
grown
-
up
at
times
when
it
was
most
needed
.

This
fact
was
exhibited
in
many
of
his
writings
and
communications
.
For
example
,
in
order
to
achieve
incremental
improvement
in
the
debate
about
what
hit
the
Pentagon
,
Legge
advocated
a
“precautionary
principle
,
”
urging
everyone
to
assert
only
what
was
truly
known
.
In
order
to
address
arguments
raised
in
support
of
the
“flyover”
case
,
Legge
wrote
a
paper
on
the
Search
for
Consensus
to
seek
common
ground
.

In
the
last
decade
of
his
life
,
Frank
Legge
had
a
tremendous
influence
on
many
people
around
the
world
.
He
led
scientific
inquiry
into
one
of
the
most
controversial
subjects
in
history
and
he
collaborated
positively
with
many
fellow
citizens
to
reveal
the
truth
.
Those
of
us
who
worked
with
him
during
this
time
will
remember
his
intelligence
,
dignity
,
and
respect
for
others
.
