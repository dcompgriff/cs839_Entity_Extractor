A
flash
mob
of
over
150
blacks
teens
assaulted
numerous
people
on
Friday
in
Philadelphia
in
an
attack
that
appears
to
have
been
racially
motivated,
and
yet
the
media
is
silent
about
this
possible
motivation.

LifeZette
reports
that
the
racial
component
of
the
attack
was
evident
in
a
Facebook
post
written
by
Joe
Lauletta
,
whose
daughter,
Christina,
was
attacked
by
the
flash
mob
on
Friday.
Lauletta
wrote
that
he
received
a
phone
call
from
Christina,
who
tearfully
explained
that
she
"was
jumped"
and
"beat
up
pretty
bad."

"I
find
out
that
her
and
her
2
male
friends
where
badly
beaten
by
a
group
of
30-40
black
teenagers
on
their
way
home
from
the
Temple
football
game,"
Lauletta
wrote.
"This
happened
after
they
got
off
the
subway
at
Broad
and
Cecil
B
Moore.
These
sick
animals
held
her
down
and
kicked
and
stomped
on
her
repeatedly.
Thank
god,
the
people
from
the
pizza
place
intervened."

While
no
bones
were
broken,
Christina
was
"badly
bruised"
throughout
her
body,
Lauletta
said
"it
makes
me
cry
just
thinking
about
it."

Lauletta's
post
seemed
to
indicate
the
racial
aspect
of
the
attack,
and
on
Tuesday
he
posted
on
Facebook
that
"the
FBI
is
investigating"
and
"are
analyzing
all
video
coverage,"
signaling
that
the
FBI
is
looking
into
the
attack
as
a
hate
crime.

In
an
interview
with
the
New
York
Post
,
Lauletta
wouldn't
explicitly
say
the
attack
was
racially
motivated
but
sort
of
implied
it:

“Well,
I
haven’t
been
saying
that
because
everybody
is
trying
to
get
me
to
say
it
and
I
don’t
know
if
I
want
to
be
that
person,”
Lauletta
told
The
Post.
“Everyone
can
draw
their
own
conclusions.”

Lauletta
said
the
possibility
of
the
attacks
being
motivated
by
race
–
perhaps
as
a
sort
of
gang
initiation
–
was
part
of
the
reason
why
his
story
was
shared
so
frequently
and
as
far
away
as
Africa.

“That’s
why
it
spread
so
fast,”
Lauletta
said.
“If
you
read
my
Facebook
page,
everybody’s
saying
it.”

However,
Philadelphia
Police
Lt.
John
Stanford
insisted
to
the
Post
that
"there
hasn’t
been
any
indication
that
race
is
involved
in
this
in
any
shape
or
form."

Even
still,
the
media
hasn't
reported
that
the
attack
is
possibly
a
hate
crime,
as
LifeZette
points
out:

Friday
violence
as
teen
mob
attacks
Temple
students,
police;
four
arrested,”
read
the
headline
on
Philly.com,
while
the
Philly
Voice
reported
“Teens
arrested
after
flash
mob
leads
to
assaults
on
Broad
Street.”
The
Associated
Press
headline
read:
“STUDENTS
BEATEN,
HORSE
PUNCHED
IN
MOB
ATTACKS
AT
UNIVERSITY.

The
Washington
Post
buried
the
possibility
in
their
story
and
then
dismissed
it
with
Stanford's
quote.

LifeZette
also
noted
that
Temple
University
described
the
attack
as
"a
large
group
of
approximately
200
juveniles
causing
disruption
along
Broad
Street."

Maybe
Stanford
is
correct
that
it
was
a
random
attack,
or
maybe
the
black
flash
mob
was
targeting
whites.
But
there
is
no
doubting
the
media's
hypocrisy:
if
this
were
a
flash
mob
of
white
teenagers
that
attacked
blacks,
the
media
would
be
screaming
about
it
being
a
hate
crime.
But
since
the
incident
in
Philadelphia
does
not
advance
the
media's
racial
narrative,
they
will
not
treat
it
in
the
same
manner.
