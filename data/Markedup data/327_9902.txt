“We
learn
from
history
that
we
do
not
learn
from
history,”
observed
German
philosopher
Georg
Hegel.
Perhaps
nothing
illustrates
this
better
than
a
new
survey
showing
that
far
too
many
“millennials”
are
not
just
cool
to
“capitalism,”
but
are
actually
cool
with
communism.
As
MarketWatch
reports
:
Of
the
2,300
Americans
polled
by
YouGov
,
80%
of
baby
boomers
and
91%
of
the
elderly
agree
with
the
statement
that
“communism
was
and
still
is
a
problem”
in
the
world
today.
Millennials?
Only
55%.
Furthermore,
almost
half
of
Americans
between
the
ages
of
16
and
20
said
they
would
vote
for
a
socialist,
while
21%
would
go
so
far
as
to
back
a
communist.
Capitalism,
on
the
other
hand,
is
viewed
favorably
by
64%
of
those
over
the
age
of
65,
compared
with
only
42%
of
millennials.

Citing
these
results,
the
Victims
of
Communism
Memorial
Foundation’s
Marion
Smith
stated,
as
quoted
by
MarketWatch
,
“One
of
the
concerns
[the
foundation]
has
had
since
its
establishment
is
that
an
emerging
generation
of
Americans
has
little
understanding
of
the
collectivist
system
and
its
dark
history.”
For
sure.
This
was
evidenced
when
a
teenager
once
naively
asked
me,
“What’s
so
bad
about
communism?”
Another
registered
a
look
of
shock
when
I
gave
him
part
of
the
answer:
During
the
20th
century,
Marxist
governments
exterminated
approximately
100
million
people,
making
them
history’s
most
murderous
ideologues.

Related
to
this,
MarketWatch
also
tells
us
that
“a
third
of
millennials
say
they
believe
more
people
were
killed
under
George
W.
Bush
than
Joseph
Stalin,”
clearly
oblivious
to
Stalin’s
psychopathic
actions
having
accounted
for
upwards
of
20
million
of
the
above
number.
Of
course,
82
percent
of
millennials
at
least
knew
who
Stalin
was.
This
cannot
be
said
regarding
Chinese
leader
Mao
Tse-tung;
42
percent
of
millennials
were
unfamiliar
with
this
mass
murderer
of
approximately
60
million.
Forty
percent
didn’t
know
who
Argentine
Marxist
and
major
Cuban
Revolution
figure
Che
Guevara
was.
With
respect
to
Vladimir
Lenin
and
Karl
Marx,
the
“unacquainted
with”
figures
were,
respectively,
33
and
32
percent.

Not
surprisingly,
this
ignorance
goes
beyond
history.
While
it’s
troubling
that
almost
half
of
those
aged
16
to
20
would
support
a
socialist,
there’s
good
and
bad
news
here.
And
they’re
the
same
thing:

These
young
people
generally
don’t
know
what
socialism
is.

As
I
wrote
in
February,
“People
18
to
29
just
helped
vault
Senator
Bernie
Sanders
to
a
resounding
New
Hampshire
primary
victory,
not
at
all
deterred
by
his
socialist
label.
But
while
they
view
that
positively,
they
don’t
believe
in
socialist
(in
Sanders’)
wealth
redistribution.
In
fact,
this
research
shows
that
they
cotton
to
it
little
more
than
do
average
Americans
and
no
more
than
their
age
group
did
20
years
ago.
In
other
words,
millennials
may
like
the
word
socialism,
but,
as
with
so
many
others,
they
don’t
understand
well
what
it
signifies
or
the
nature
of
those
for
whom
they
vote.”

In
reality,
the
label
“socialism”
is
applied
loosely
today,
yet
it
has
a
firm
definition.
Note
that
socialism
was
popularized
via
Karl
Marx’s
and
Friedrich
Engels’
Communist
Manifesto
.
And
under
Marxist
doctrine,
“socialism”
—
or
the
socialist
revolution
—
is
the
transitional
phase
that
extinguishes
economic
freedom
and
ushers
in
communism.
Moreover,
there
are
no
communist
governments
because
“communism”
is
the
culmination
of
socialism,
the
stage
where,
the
fanciful
theory
goes,
the
government
has
melted
away
and
everyone
lives
happily
and
harmoniously
in
a
state
of
economic
equality-induced
bliss.

This
is
why
the
Iron
Curtain-disgorging
evil
empire
could,
with
a
straight
collective
face,
call
itself
the
Union
of
Soviet
Socialist
Republics.
And
it’s
why
we
should
see
a
red
flag
(pun
intended)
when
a
politician
such
as
Bernie
Sanders
calls
himself
a
socialist.
Maybe
he’s
more
wizened
than
wise
and
doesn’t
really
know
what
the
word
means
—
or,
perhaps,
he
knows
full
well
—
and
is
capitalizing
on
the
fact
that
others
don’t.

Whatever
the
case,
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
view
socialist
seduction
as
solely
a
“millennial”
problem,
as
this
only
sparks
intergenerational
squabbling.
For
there
are
old
fools
and
young
fools
and
much
foolishness
in-between.
Yet
while
we
recognize
that
people
are
largely
products
of
their
upbringing,
we
nonetheless
will
analyze
a
given
generation
as
if
it’s
a
breed
apart
as
opposed
to
what
it
almost
always
is:
the
next
iteration
in
a
pattern.

Consider
how
80
percent
of
Boomers
consider
communism
a
problem.
While
a
high
number,
it’s
still
a
statistically
significant
drop
from
their
elders’
91
percent
figure.
And
this
is
just
part
of
a
pattern,
with
the
percentage
of
each
age
group
that
views
“socialism”
positively
being
as
follows:
age
65+,
13
percent;
50-64,
25
percent;
30-49,
34
percent;
18-29,
49
percent
(
Pew
Research
Center
,
Dec.
28,
2011).
Evident
here
isn’t
an
overnight
sea-change,
but
steadily
increasing
ignorance.

Tragically,
this
is
a
worldwide
phenomenon.
Marxism
has
to
an
extent
taken
hold
in
Japan
,
Spain
,
and
elsewhere,
and
Karl
Marx
is
more
popular
than
he
has
been
in
decades.
As
I
wrote
in
2013,
“Sales
of
The
Communist
Manifesto
(the
best-selling
book
in
history
next
to
the
Bible)
and
Das
Kapital
have
soared
since
the
2008
financial
crisis.
Karl
Marx
was
voted
‘favorite
philosopher’
by
BBC
radio
listeners,
beating
out
contenders
such
as
Plato,
Aristotle,
Socrates,
and
Thomas
Aquinas.
And
in
an
irony
akin
to
having
Marx’s
picture
on
a
Bible
tract,
his
image
is
the
one
most
often
chosen
by
customers
of
Germany’s
Sparkasse
Chemnitz
Bank
—
for
their
credit
cards.”

Given
the
above,
it’s
not
surprising
that
what
inspired
mockery
of
late
Senator
Joe
McCarthy
has
become
reality:
Marxist
types
abound
in
our
government.
New
York
City
elected
“Bolshevik”
Bill
de
Blasio,
who
raised
money
for
the
Sandinistas,
subscribed
to
their
newsletter,
and
honeymooned
in
Cuba.
John
Drew,
a
former
Barack
Obama
acquaintance
and
reformed
Marxist
with
whom
I’ve
spoken
personally,
revealed
that
when
he
knew
Obama,
Obama
was
an
“ardent
Marxist-Leninist”
who
“was
in
100
percent,
total
agreement
with
[his]
Marxist
professors”;
this
is
no
surprise
because
Obama’s
mentor,
Frank
Marshall
Davis,
was
a
card-carrying
member
of
the
Communist
Party
USA.

Then
there
are
Obama’s
appointees,
such
as
former
“Green
Jobs
Czar”
and
self-proclaimed
communist
Van
Jones;
former
communications
director
Anita
Dunn,
who
said
that
Mao
Tse-tung
was
one
of
her
“two
favorite
philosophers”;
“Manufacturing
Czar”
Ron
Bloom,
who
said
in
a
speech,
“We
agree
with
Mao”;
and
“Global
Warming
Czar”
Carol
Browner,
who
was
until
recently
listed
as
a
leader
of
the
socialist
organization
“Commission
for
a
Sustainable
World
Society.”

And,
finally,
there’s
the
woman
who
wants
to
succeed
Obama,
Hillary
Clinton.
Former
Clinton
operative
Larry
Nichols
tells
us
that
when
he
first
met
her,
in
the
1970s,
she
was
wearing
a
medal
around
her
neck
stating,
“Proud
member
of
the
American
Communist
Party”
(video
here
;
forward
to
6:07).
No
wonder
the
Communist
Party
USA
is
“all
in”
for
Hillary
.

It’s
also
no
wonder
that
Clinton
is
beating
Donald
Trump
by
28
points
among
under-30
voters.
But
tolerance
for
socialism/communism
is
intolerable.
If
we
learned
that
almost
half
of
young
Americans
would
vote
for
a
fascist
and
21
percent
would
go
so
far
as
to
back
a
Nazi,
we’d
rightly
be
aghast.
Instead,
they’re
warming
to
the
ideological
descendants
of
even
more
prolific
killers.
Hey,
what’s
100
million
victims
between
comrades?
