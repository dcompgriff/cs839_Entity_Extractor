Two
chief
fundraisers
for
the
Clinton
Foundation
pressed
corporate
donors
to
steer
business
opportunities
to
former
President
Bill
Clinton
as
well,
according
to
a
hacked
memo
published
Wednesday
by
WikiLeaks.

The
November
2011
memo
from
Douglas
Band,
at
the
time
a
top
aide
to
Mr.
Clinton
,
outlines
extensive
fundraising
efforts
that
Mr.
Band
and
a
partner
deployed
on
behalf
of
the
Clinton
Foundation
and
how
that
work
sometimes
translated
into
large
speaking
fees
and
other
paid
work
for
Mr.
Clinton.

The
memo,
part
of
a
cache
of
emails
stolen
from
Democratic
presidential
nominee
Hillary
Clinton’s
campaign
manager,
resurfaces
an
issue
that
she
has
had
a
hard
time
shaking:
questions
over
the
relationship
between
the
Clintons’
charity
work
and
their
personal
business.

Mr.
Band
and
an
associate
introduced
top
corporate
executives
to
the
former
president,
on
the
golf
course
and
elsewhere,
and
then
asked
them
to
contribute
money
to
the
Clinton
Foundation
or
attend
the
Clinton
Global
Initiative,
an
annual
foundation
event.
