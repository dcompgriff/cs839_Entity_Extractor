that
with
each
passing
day,
more
compromising
of
national
security,
self-serving
and
self-enriching
behaviors,
frauds,
scams
and
general
malfeasance
on
the
part
of
Hillary
Clinton
come
to
light
via
new
Wikileaks
data
dumps.
But
the
news
media’s
obsession
with
things
Donald
Trump
has
said
consistently
overshadows
things
Hillary
Clinton
has
actually
done.

Revelations
have
now
surfaced
that
Clinton
backed
the
Puerto
Rico
Debt
Relief
Bill
,
a
plan
to
help
the
financially
struggling
U.S.
commonwealth
deal
with
a
$70
billion
debt
it
managed
to
rack
up,
after
a
top
Clinton
fundraiser
–who
just
happens
to
be
a
lobbyist
for
the
Puerto
Rican
treasury—
emailed
his
brother
to
discuss
the
situation.

Who
is
this
brother?
None
other
than
John
David
Podesta,
Chairman
of
the
2016
Hillary
Clinton
campaign.

The
brother,
Tony
Podesta,
has
been
well-compensated
by
Puerto
Rico.
The
Puerto
Rican
treasury
department
has
paid
Hillary
Clinton’s
campaign
chairman’s
brother’s
firm
nearly
two
million
dollars!

The
email
in
question
is
from
March
2015.
At
that
point
Puerto
Rican
treasury
had
already
paid
Tony’s
firm,
The
Podesta
Group,
the
$1.9
million
since
enlisting
the
firm’s
services,
whatever
those
are,
in
2013.
How
does
a
government
$70
billion
in
debt
cough
up
$1.9
million
to
pay
a
consultancy
firm,
and
what
consulting
or
services
was
that
firm
providing?
Specifically.

Tony
Podesta,
serving
as
President
of
The
Podesta
Group,
emailed
his
brother
with
a
subject
line
of
“Puerto
Rico.”
The
body
of
the
email
asked,
“Can
you
call
me
today
re
PR.
Need
advice
not
action.”
At
the
time
Tony
Podesta
and
other
lobbyists
in
the
firm
were
pushing
for
passage
of
congressional
legislation
to
allow
Puerto
Rico
to
restructure
its
debt
through
a
Chapter
9
bankruptcy
filing.

A
few
months
after
the
email
between
the
Podesta
brothers,
Clinton
officially
backed
congressional
legislation
authorizing
Chapter
9
proceedings.
Amazing
timing.

So
Hillary
formally
backed
legislation
to
relieve
Puerto
Rico
of
billions
of
dollars
in
debt
after
her
campaign
manager’s
brother
emailed
him
seeking
“advice”
and
after
his
client
had
paid
him
$1.9
million
for
“services.”

What
could
those
services
be?
Could
they
be…
using
one’s
connections
in
Washington
to
help
see
to
it
the
passage
of
a
debt
relief
bill
is
assured?

If
this
doesn’t
sound
like
influence
peddling,
read
on.

In
addition
to
being
her
campaign
manager’s
brother,
Tony
Podesta
is
a
high-dollar
Clinton
donor
and
fundraiser.
According
to
Federal
Election
Commission
filings
he
has
provided
“
reportable
bundled
contributions
”
of
about
$200,000
for
the
campaign.

He
has
also
donated
between
$25,000
and
$50,000
to
–surprise,
surprise–
The
Clinton
Foundation.
Is
there
anyone
too
shady
for
this
foundation
to
accept
cash
from?

How
many
instances
of
cash
contributions
to
the
Clinton
Foundation
in
exchange
for
favors,
…allegedly…
have
there
been
now?
One
can
barely
keep
track.
We
also
just
learned
(also
through
Wikileaks)
that
the
government
of
Qatar
gave
the
Clinton
Foundation
a
$1
million
check
for
Bill’s
birthday
.

Why
would
a
foreign
government,
any
foreign
government,
let
alone
one
in
the
Middle
East,
give
a
million
dollars
as
a
birthday
gift?
The
secrecy,
corruption,
payoffs
and
general
level
of
suspicious
activity
that
surrounds
this
couple
is
astounding.

Exactly
what
the
Podestas
talked
about
isn’t
known,
but
other
hacked
emails
show
that
Clinton
specifically
asked
her
staff
to
craft
public
statements
in
support
of
Puerto
Rican
debt
relief
after
the
Podesta
brothers
apparently
discussed
the
issue,
but
before
Hillary
publicly
backed
Chapter
9
proceedings.
Could
it
be
that
some
of
that
$1.9
million
made
it
into
Clinton
Foundation
bank
accounts?

Congress
eventually
passed
and
the
president
signed
a
Puerto
debt
relief
package.
As
of
this
writing,
neither
the
Clinton
campaign
nor
the
Podesta
Group
had
responded
to
requests
for
additional
information.

This
cozy,
cash-laden
exchange
typifies
exactly
what
Donald
Trump
has
tapped
into.
Americans
by-and-large
believe
there
is
so
much
corruption,
so
much
cronyism,
so
many
snakes
in
the
grasses
around
Washington
that
everyone
is
on
the
take,
everyone
is
into
someone’s
pockets
and
the
entire
brood
is
wallowing
around
in
the
muck
of
get-rich
politics.
Wikileaks
having
hacked
John
Podesta’s
email
account
and
putting
this
information
into
the
public
domain
only
confirms
the
suspicions.

Of
course
the
other
suspicion
is
that
our
“mainstream
media”
is
equally
corrupt
and
will
not
cover
stories
like
this
one.
Sadly,
the
American
public
is
mostly
right
on
both
counts.
