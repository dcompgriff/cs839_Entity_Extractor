The
mixed
reactions
over
the
election
results
is
certainly
no
secret.
Some
are
terrified
and
devastated,
others
are
joyous,
feeling
hopeful
and
are
starting
to
think
the
elite
lost
some
control
on
this
one.
Russell
Brand
had
some
rather
interesting
insight
that
resonated
deeply
with
me
as
it’s
precisely
what
I’ve
been
sharing
since
the
night
of
the
election:
don’t
lose
hope.
More
on
that
below,
but
first
please
read
this
important
perspective.
The
fact
Trump
‘got
in’
shows
that,
more
than
anything,
people
really
want
change.
They
are
tired
of
the
same
old
stuff,
and
enough
was
brought
to
the
surface
about
how
corrupt
Hillary
is
that
people
wanted
to
try
something
different.During
the
tail
end
of
election
night,
as
social
media
lit
up,
I
remember
feeling
that
the
election
result
and
the
Brexit
result
brought
forth
very
similar
reactions.
Many
did
what
the
media
told
them
to
do
and
simply
began
calling
out
‘the
stupid
people,
racist
people
and
uneducated
people!’
But
the
truth
is,
we
won’t
see
the
world
clearly
with
that
worldview,
we’re
being
challenged
to
expand
our
consciousness
here
and
I
for
one
believe
that
is
our
course
of
action.
Bernie
Blues
All
in
hindsight!
Although
Bernie
had
the
popular
vote
before,
Hillary,
the
DNC
and
the
media
worked
to
knock
him
out.
Now
more
than
ever
everyone
wants
Bernie
back,
and
while
people
think
it’s
a
mistake
that
he
didn’t
get
in,
it’s
not.
It’s
perfect.
because
that’s
what
it
took
to
get
people
to
realize
the
system
is
rigged
.
You
see,
you
can’t
pick
and
choose
when
to
say
that
‘everything
happens
for
a
reason’
and
that
‘everything
is
perfect’
and
‘consciousness
creates
reality’
etc.
Those
are
universal
truths
that
remain
true
regardless
of
what
is
taking
place.
When
something
doesn’t
go
our
way
we
fall
out
of
awareness
and
into
ego.
We
begin
burying
ourselves
in
emotion.
It
would
be
better,
instead,
to
accept
what
happened
and
begin
asking
why?
And
how?
What
can
we
learn
from
this
and
why
did
we
co-create
this
reality?
Think
about
it,
what
is
more
important
given
our
incredibly
messed
up
situation?
Having
another
president
we
feel
OK
about
or
now
having
the
world
know
that
the
elections
are
rigged?
There
is
a
corrupt
elite
running
our
world
and
that
now
sets
the
stage
for
discussion
on
where
we
can
go
from
here.
It
is
imperative
that
we
come
to
terms
with
and
understand
our
current
state
without
turning
a
blind
eye
to
what’s
really
going
on.
If
we
don’t
do
that,
we
won’t
be
able
to
come
up
with
solutions
that
truly
work.
Shifting
consciousness
includes
seeing
things
clearly
and
learning
the
lesson
this
cycle
is
trying
to
teach
us.
(...)
What
Now?
So
where
do
we
go
from
here?
What’s
next?
Well,
the
first
step
is
to
process
the
emotions
and
the
fear
that’s
getting
in
the
way
of
us
seeing
the
truth.
If
we
keep
getting
caught
up
in
them,
we’re
only
going
to
create
even
more
problems
—
which
is
our
choice.
But
ask
yourself
if
you
feel
it’s
necessary
to
do
this
given
that
a
quick
shift
in
awareness
can
help
us
see
more
clearly
and
help
us
begin
a
different
set
of
discussions.
The
next
step
would
be
having
the
conversation
about
the
elephant
in
the
room:
it’s
troubling
that
after
all
these
years,
we
still
show
up
at
the
polling
stations
to
vote
for
a
system
that
doesn’t
have
the
people’s
interests
in
mind
and
that
is
only
making
things
worse
as
each
year
goes
by.
With
a
shift
in
consciousness
and
awareness,
we
can
start
creating
something
new
.
