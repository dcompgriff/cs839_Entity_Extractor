The
Far
Left
Is
Planning
The
Biggest
Political
Protest
In
United
States
History
For
Inauguration
Day


13th,
2016

We
have
seen
very
large
protests
in
major
cities
all
over
America
since
Donald


the
biggest
one
of
all
is
being
planned
for
January
20th.
Radical
leftists
are
calling
for
thousands
upon
thousands
of
activists
to
descend
upon
Washington
D.C.
on
Inauguration
Day,
and
they
are
planning
to
disrupt
the
inauguration
festivities
as
much
as
they
possibly
can.
And
if
you
doubt
that
the
“Not
My
President”
movement
can
pull
this
off,
you
may
want
to
consider
that
25,000
protesters
showed
up
in
New
York
City
on
Saturday
on
very
short
notice.
These
people
are
bitter,
angry,
frustrated
and
incredibly
motivated.
At
this
point
they
still
have
more
than
two
months
to
organize
their
forces,
and
many
are
expecting
that
this
is
going
to
be
the
most
chaotic
Inauguration
Day
in
American
history.

One
of
the
Facebook
pages
that
is
attempting
to
recruit
protesters
for
Inauguration
Day
is
entitled
“Protest
at
the
Inauguration:
Stand
Against
Trump,
War,
Racism
and
Inequality”.
So
far,
7,800


that
they
will
be
attending
on
this
page
alone,
and
another
26,000
have
expressed
interest
in
the
protest.
The
organizers
of
this
particular
page
are
very
clear
about
why
they
believe
that
the
inauguration
of
Donald
Trump
must
be
protested
…

Donald
Trump
is
a
racist,
sexist
bigot.
We
believe
that
tens
of
thousands
of
progressive
people
will
be
in
the
streets
on
Inauguration
Day
and
in
the
weeks
and
months
afterward.

How
one
voted
on
election
day
is
one
thing,
but
even
more
important
is
whether
we
succeed
in
building
a
mass
movement
that
can
truly
change
the
country,
and
the
world.

Waiting
for
the
same
politicians
who
led
to
the
rise
of
Trump
to
now
stop
him
is
a
lost
cause.

On
Facebook
and
Twitter,
the
hashtag
#DisruptJ20
is
already
generating
an
immense
amount
of
buzz.
This
movement
appears
to
be
very
well
funded,
and
they
have
already
produced
some
very
slick
videos
promoting
the
upcoming
inauguration
protest.

#DisruptJ20
even
has
an
official
website
now,
and
they
are
openly
calling
for
a
national
strike
on
January
20th
in
addition
to
the
chaos
that
they
plan
to
cause
in
Washington…

On
January
20th,
the
day
of
the
Presidential
Inauguration,
protesters
will
rally
to
interrupt
Trump’s
coronation.
You
can
help
organize,
and
you
can
attend
the
march
.
You
can
also
heed
calls
to
strike
,
wherever
you
are
in
the
country.

On
January
21st,
millions
of
women
will
converge
on
Washington
DC
specifically
to
oppose
the
Trump
administration’s
promised
attack
on
women’s
rights
and
freedoms.
Join
them.

And
on
the
#DisruptJ20
Facebook
page
,
the
organizers
are
very
open
about
the
fact
that
they
plan
to
bitterly
fight
against
Donald
Trump
every
step
of
the
way…

On
Friday,
January
20,
2017,
Donald
Trump
will
be
inaugurated
as


call
on
all
people
of
good
conscience
to
join
in
disrupting
the
ceremonies.
If
Trump
is
to
be
inaugurated
at
all,
let
it
happen
behind
closed
doors,
showing
the
true
face
of
the
security
state
Trump
will
preside
over.
It
must
be
made
clear
to
the
whole
world
that
the
vast
majority
of
people
in
the
United
States
do
not
support
his
presidency
or
consent
to
his
rule.

Trump
stands
for
tyranny,
greed,
and
misogyny.
He
is
the
champion
of
neo-nazis
and
white
Nationalists,
of
the
police
who
kil
l
the
Black,
Brown
and
poor
on
a
daily
basis,
of
racist
border
agents
and
sadistic
prison
guards,
of
the
FBI
and
NSA
who
tap
your
phone
and
read
your
email.
He
is
the
harbinger
of
even
more
climate
catastrophe,
deportation,
discrimination,
and
endless
war.
He
continues
to
deny
the
existence
of
climate
change,
in
spite
of
all
the
evidence,
putting
the
future
of
the
whole
human
race
at
stake.
The
KKK,
Vladimir
Putin,
Golden
Dawn,
and
the
Islamic
State
all
cheered
his
victory.
If
we
let
his
inauguration
go
unchallenged,
we
are
opening
the
door
to
the
future
they
envision.

Trump’s
success
confirms
the
bankruptcy
of
representative
democracy.
Rather
than
using
the
democratic
process
as
an
alibi
for
inaction,
we
must
show
that
no
election
could
legitimize
his
agenda.
Neither
the
Democrats
nor
any
other
political
party
or
politician
will
save
us—they
just
offer
a
weaker
version
of
the
same
thing.
If
there
is
going
to
be
positive
change
in
this
society,
we
have
to
make
it
ourselves,
together,
through
direct
action.

From
day
one,
the
Trump
presidency
will
be
a
disaster.
#DisruptJ20
will
be
the
start
of
the
resistance.
We
must
take
to
the
streets
and
protest,
blockade,
disrupt,
intervene,
sit
in,
walk
out,
rise
up,
and
make
more
noise
and
good
trouble
than
the
establishment
can
bear.
The
parade
must
be
stopped.
We
must
delegitimize
Trump
and
all
he
represents.
It’s
time
to
defend
ourselves,
our
loved
ones,
and
the
world
that
sustains
us
as
if
our
lives
depend
on
it—because
they
do.

Some
have
noted
that
2017
will
be
the
100
year
anniversary
of
the
communist
revolution
in
Russia,
and
many
on
the
radical
left
are
now
openly
using
the
word
“revolution”
to
describe
what
they
would
like
to
see
here
in
the
United
States.

And
this
call
to
protest
Donald
Trump’s
inauguration
appears
to
have
originated
with
a
Marxist
politician
out
in
Seattle
…

A
self-avowed
Marxist
member
of
the
Seattle
City
Council
who
is
part
of
the
George
Soros-funded
Occupy
Wall
Street
movement
has
called
for
a
“massive
protest”


Trump
and
a
“nationwide
shut
down”
on
Inauguration
Day.

Kshama
Sawant
went
on
an
anti-Trump
rant
following
the
election
that
stirred
up
progressives’
emotions
against
Trump
voters,
calling
them
part
of
“a
racist
agenda.”

Sawant
held
a
press
conference
calling
for
a
mass
protest
in
Seattle.
That
protest
was
attended
by
students,
members
of
Seattle’s
LGBTQ
community,
as
well
as
Occupy
members
and
Muslims.

Many
had
been
hoping
that
the
nationwide
protests
against
Donald
Trump
would
be
quieting
down
by
now,
but
that
does
not
appear
to
be
happening.
Instead,
they
just
seem
to
keep
getting
more
intense.
Just
check
out
what
took
place
around
the
country
on
Saturday
…

Seventy-one
people
were
arrested
in
Portland,
Oregon,
where
crowds
threw
burning
road
flares
at
officers.

Hundreds
gathered
outside
City
Hall
in
Los
Angeles
to
face
off
against
riot
police
after
a
daytime
march
with
drew
8,000
people.

Other
rallies
took
place
in
Atlanta,
Salt
Lake
City,
Washington
DC,
and
Phoenix,
as
the
anti-Trump
backlash
continued
to
grow.

In
Indianapolis,
crowds
chanted
‘kill
the
police’
as
they
threw
rocks
at
officers
in
a
separate
protest.

At
other
times,
Barack
Obama
has
stepped
in
and
condemned
protests
when
they
have
gotten
violent.

So
why
is
he
just
sitting
back
and
saying
nothing
now?

As
the
president
of
the
United
States,
shouldn’t
he
be
trying
to
calm
everyone
down?

It
is
easy
to
see
how
the
“Not
My
President”
movement
could
continue
to
grow
and
reach
a
crescendo
on
January
20th,
2017.

Normally
Inauguration
Day
is
a
day
of
joy
and
gladness
for
the
nation,
but
this
time
around
we
may
see
unprecedented
scenes
of
chaos,
rioting
and
violence.

At
this
point,
there
appears
to
be
no
possible
way
that
the
entire
nation
is
going
to
unite
behind
President
Trump,
and
many
are
wondering
if
we
are
now
entering
four
years
of
the
worst
civil
unrest
that
the
United
States
has
ever
experienced.

Why
is
Obama
sitting
back
now
and
not
saying
anything?
Could
it
be
he
was
actually
working
behind
the
scenes
to
protect
and
help
set
up
these
organizations
during
his
entire
presidency?
Seems
obvious
that
with
the
speed
and
organization
with
which
they
have
begun
marching
in
the
streets
since
Wednesday
the
organizations
were
in
place
well
before
the
election
was
held,
yes?
Almost
as
if
someone
deliberately
wanted
Trump
to
win
to
begin
the
riots
acoss
the
nation!
A.S.

Every
person
involved
with
those
riots
should
be
put
in
prison
for
life!
They
are
vermin,
cockroaches,
evil
people.
I
didn’t
see
republicans
or
conservatives
protesting
Obama
like
this
after
both
of
his
election
wins.
I
hope
this
country
turns
around
soon.

God
raises
up
leaders
as

wishes.
Apparently,
there
was
a
supernatural
force
behind
Mr.
Trump
victory.
At
the
time
when
he
was
prayed
for
by
leading
evengalicals
God
almighty
put
His
hand
on
him.
His
saw
the
humidity
in
his
heart.
No
matter
what
the
enemy
is
throwing
at
him
no
harm
shall
come
near
him.
With
all
the
hate
that
has
originated
from
the
west
coast
toward
Mr.
Trump
has
not
gone
unnoticed
by
God.
I
believe
a
day
of
reckening
will
soon
scent
on
the
west
coast.
Brace
yourself
America.
Keep
Mr.
Trump
in
your
prayers.
