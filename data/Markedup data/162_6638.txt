The
New
World
Order
might
seem
a
bit
far
-
fetched
for
many
.
A
handful
of
powerful
people
acting
as
puppet
masters
for
the
human
race
is
a
thought
that
might
not
even
cross
the
minds
of
many
that
have
seamlessly
adapted
to
the
beliefs
that
were
instilled
in
them
from
a
young
age
.
The
thought
that
we
are
all
being
controlled
and
enslaved
by
the
banks
with
the
aid
of
the
government
is
for
conspiracy
theorists
.
There
is
no
doubt
that
there
are
negative
connotations
associated
with
being
a
conspiracy
theorist
.
That
belief
has
been
re
-
iterated
many
times
,
mostly
from
the
mainstream
media
.
There
are
people
who
see
the
world
for
what
they
are
told
it
is
,
others
see
what’s
really
going
on
behind
the
curtain
.
The
stranglehold
the
global
elite
have
on
money
and
knowledge
makes
them
very
powerful
.
They
either
directly
or
indirectly
control
every
aspect
of
our
lives
.

Global
mega
-
corporations
make
up
to
billions
of
dollars
on
an
annual
basis
.
A
select
few
at
the
top
of
the
company
make
absurd
amounts
of
money
,
while
the
employees
making
the
difference
and
driving
the
company
forward
are
barely
paid
enough
money
to
stay
afloat
.
If
humans
stay
busy
working
40
weekly
hours
for
very
little
income
,
they
won’t
have
the
time
or
the
resources
to
realize
they
have
been
dealt
a
bad
hand
.
The
top
1
percent
doesn’t
want
Americans
to
be
any
more
educated
then
to
have
the
ability
to
help
operate
and
patronize
their
business’
.

The
global
elite
have
a
system
in
place
which
allows
them
to
grow
their
global
banking
empire
.
All
of
humanity
are
literally
slaves
to
the
economic
system
.
Money
is
necessary
for
our
survival
in
the
real
world
today
.
Most
people
will
spend
the
majority
of
their
time
working
just
to
survive
in
the
system
.
If
money
is
the
god
of
our
time
,
that
makes
Rothschild
his
prophet
.
Public
School
programs
worldwide
are
where
the
global
elite
first
begin
to
shape
our
minds
.
They
continue
the
shaping
through
the
media
.
We
are
taught
what
they
want
us
to
know
and
nothing
more
.

The
rich
continue
to
get
richer
by
purchasing
up
many
successful
smaller
businesses
.
When
the
top
1
percent
owns
the
majority
of
banks
,
resources
and
even
our
governments
,
it
means
big
problems
for
the
people
.
The
Rothschilds’
are
worth
over
$
500
trillion
and
they
are
just
1
of
13
families
that
pretty
much
collectively
own
the
world
.
The
Rothschilds’
alone
could
pay
off
the
US
national
debt
26
times
over
.
Unfortunately
they
would
never
do
such
a
thing
because
they
own
the
majority
of
the
world’s
central
banks
.
The
New
World
Order’s
agenda
is
slowly
taking
small
steps
toward
complete
and
definitive
enslavement
through
use
of
the
monetary
system
and
ownership
of
resources
.
