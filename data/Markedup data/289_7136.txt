long
“shit

The
“
Shit
-
In
at
Whitmore
”
demonstration
began
Monday
morning
at
the
Whitmore
Administration
building
(
which
the
activists
have
nicknamed
“Queermore”
)
,
and
organizers
intend
to
have
students
continue
occupying
stalls
in
the
building’s
male
and
female
restrooms
until
their
demands
are
met
,
though
the
<[>Facebook<]>
event
specifies
a
Friday
afternoon
ending
.


“Maybe
[
administrators
]
will
feel
a
little
bit
as
anxious
as
trans
students
do
just
trying
to
pee
on
campus

<[>Gender
Liberation
UMass<]>
(
<[>GLU<]>
)
,
a
student
group
at
UMass
,
is
responsible
for
organizing
the
event
,
and
provides
an
online
sign
-
up
form
for
supporters
to
stake
out
specific
times
and
locations
,
giving
them
the
option
of
stating
whether
they
prefer
to
be
along
in
a
stall
or
to
share
one
with
“other
sitters
.
”


The
primary
goal
of
the
protest
is
to
convince
the
administration
to
convert
additional
bathrooms
on
campus
into
gender
-
neutral
facilities
by
changing
the
signage
,
which
the
group
believes
will
promote
“trans
inclusivity
and
safety
on
campus
,
”
but
GLU
has
also
articulated
two
additional
demands
,
pledging
to
continue
obstructing
toilets
until
all
three
are
met
.


In
addition
to
gender
-
neutral
restrooms
,
the
group
is
calling
for
the
“advancement
of
medically
and
socially
competent
in
-
house
transgender
health
services
at
the
University
Health
Services
center
,
”
as
well
as
the
“hiring
of
a
professor
by
the
WGSS
[
Women
,
Gender
,
and
Sexuality
Studies
Department
]
who
is
an
expert
in
the
field
of
critical
transmisogyny
from
an
intersectional
perspective
.
”

Divest
UMass
,
a
student
environmentalist
group
,
released
a
statement
on
its
<[>Facebook<]>
page
expressing
solidarity
with
the
GLU
protesters


“These
demands
are
elementary
,
and
it
is
disappointing
that
UMass
has
failed
to
meet
the
needs
of
trans
and
gender
non
-
conforming
students
to
date
.
The
administration
must
seriously
put
a
plan
into
action
to
de
-
gender
its
facilities
,
”
the
message
declares
.
“In
the
meantime
,
maybe
they
will
feel
a
little
bit
as
anxious
as
trans
students
do
just
trying
to
pee
on
the
campus
they
pay
tuition
to
every
single
day
.
”


Although
the
objectives
of
Divest
UMass
are
not
directly
related
to
those
being
pursued
by
GLU
,
but
leaders
of
the
Divest
group
explained
their
interest
in
the
“shit
-
in”
by
asserting
that
all
progressive
causes
are
interrelated
,
saying
,
“There
can
be
no
climate
justice
without
gender
justice
.
There
can
no
be
gender
justice
without
racial
justice
.
There
can
no
be
racial
justice
without
economic
justice
.
There
can
be
no
economic
justice
without
social
justice
.
”


Within
a
day
of
the
restroom
occupation
starting
,
GLU
announced
that
it
had
secured
a
meeting
with
Vice
Chancellor
of
Student
Affairs
Enku
Gelaye
on
Tuesday
morning
to
discuss
its
demands
,
and
subsequently
reported
Tuesday
evening
that
administrators
had
“tentatively
agreed
to
progressive
‘benchmarks’
put
forth
by
organizers
.
”


“The
administration
is
definitely
listening
and
the
tones
of
our
conversation
have
changed
quite
a
bit
,
”
one
GLU
member
told
Campus
Reform
,
though
the
group
is
cautioning
its
supporters
to
remain
prepared
,
because
“the
need
for
action
may
arise
at
any
moment
.
”


“Changing
the
signage
really
is
not
very
expensive
,
and
I
don’t
want
to
talk
bad
about
the
administration
here
,
but
that’s
one
of
the
things
we’ve
had
to
go
back
and
forth
about
,
is
this
idea
of
the
cost
of
it
,
”
another
GLU
member
added
.
“I
and
other
members
of
GLU
think
the
numbers
they
have
proposed
for
what
it
would
cost
to
change
the
signage
are
way
beyond
what
it
would
really
be
.
”


UMass
Executive
Director
of
Strategic
Communications
Ed
Blaguszewski
,
however
,
told
Campus
Reform
that
the
university
is
committed
to
expanding
the
availability
of
gender
-
neutral
restrooms
,
making
no
mention
of
cost
concerns
while
asserting
that
university
officials
would
continue
to
meet
regularly
with
transgender
students
to
discuss
their
concerns
.


“Currently
,
there
are
more
than
200
gender
-
inclusive
,
single
-
user
restrooms
on
campus
,
and
during
the
coming
year
more
than
50
will
be
added
,
either
by
construction
or
by
converting
single
-
user
‘Men’
or
‘Women’
facilities
to
‘Restrooms
,
’”
he
explained
,
adding
that
“All
new
construction
and
major
renovations
on
campus
will
include
gender
-
inclusive
restrooms
.
