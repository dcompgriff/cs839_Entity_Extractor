The
<[>British
government<]>
have
finally
admitted
that
marijuana
has
medicinal
value
in
helping
to
treat
a
number
of
different
illnesses
and
diseases
.

The
UK's
<[>Medicines
and
Healthcare
products
Regulatory
Agency<]>
(
MHRA
)
announced
that
Cannabidiol
(
CBD
)
has
restorative
,
correcting
or
modifying
effects
on
“physiological
functions”
when
administered
to
humans
.
In
other
words
,
cannabis
has
the
potential
to
cure
illnesses
without
the
need
for
pharmaceutical
drugs
.

Observers
say
this
new
development
in
Britain
is
a
potential
milestone
that
will
help
marijuana
campaigners
to
press
for
the
country’s
lawmakers
to
legalize
the
plant
based
on
the
available
evidence
.

Before
this
good
news
,
some
of
the
country’s
politicians
had
pressed
on
the
government
to
legalize
marijuana
for
medicinal
use
.
Currently
,
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
it
is
illegal
to
possess
marijuana
in
any
form
.
Without
a
so
-
called
appropriate
licence
,
it
is
also
illegal
to
grow
,
distribute
or
sell
marijuana
in
the
nation
.

However
,
over
the
years
,
marijuana
advocates
have
been
gaining
momentum
in
their
quest
to
have
the
plant
legalized
and
regulated
in
the
country
.
In
2015
,
James
Richard
Owen
,
an
economics
student
at
<[>Aberystwyth
University<]>
,
started
a
petition
on
the
country’s
official
petitions
website
,
calling
for
the
legalization
,
cultivation
,
sale
and
use
of
the
plant
.

The
petition
gathered
218
,
995
signatures
,
far
exceeding
the
100
,
000
needed
for
it
to
be
considered
for
debate
in
<[>Parliament<]>
.
On
Oct
.
12
,
2015
.
the
country’s
<[>Parliament<]>
debated
the
petition

The
mainstream

are
covering
up
the
fact
that
Hillary

created

and

According
to
the
<[>Independent<]>
,
the
latest
findings
by
the
<[>MHRA<]>
are
not
directly
applicable
to
the
<[>British
government's<]>
response
to
last
year’s
petition
to
legalize
marijuana
.

In
a
statement
on
the
assessment
done
by
the
<[>MHRA<]>
,
the
agency
said:
“The
<[>MHRA<]>
has
now
completed
its
review
and
has
considered
all
information
available
to
it
relating
to
Cannabidiol
(
CBD
)
and
having
taken
into
account
all
the
scientific
advice
and
evidence
,
it
has
come
to
an
opinion
that
products
containing
Cannabidiol
will
satisfy
the
second
limb
of
the
definition
of
a
‘medicinal
product’
because
it
may
be
used
by
or
administered
to
human
beings
either
with
a
view
to
restoring
,
correcting
or
modifying
physiological
functions
by
exerting
a
pharmacological
,
immunological
or
metabolic
action
,
or
to
making
a
medical
diagnosis
.

The
review
of
CBD
,
a
cannabinoid
accounting
for
up
to
40
%
of
the
marijuana
plant’s
extract
that
doesn’t
contain
its
psychoactive
THC
but
has
immense
health
benefits
,
came
about
following
discussions
with
CBD
vaporiser
company
<[>MediPen<]>
.

The
Managing
Director
of
<[>MediPen<]>
,
Jordan
Owen
was
quoted
by
the
<[>Independent<]>
as
saying:
“Since
our
inception
we’ve
worked
hard
to
obtain
our
goal
of
breaking
down
the
negative
connotations
surrounding
Cannabis
to
lead
to
a
reform
in
the
law
for
medicinal
use
.
Now
this
is
finally
becoming
a
reality
,
which
will
provide
ground
-
breaking
results
.
”

Past
studies
on
marijuana
have
revealed
its
CBD
helps
to
control
brain
and
nerve
activity
,
energy
metabolism
,
heart
function
,
the
immune
system
and

To
add
to
the
<[>MHRA's<]>
findings
,
the
British
pro
-
marijuana
pharma
company
,
<[>GW
Pharmaceuticals<]>
,
has
also
announced
it
has
just
concluded
a
positive
phase
3
clinical
trial
demonstrating
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
CBD
,
which
has
helped
people
with
a
variety
of
illnesses
.

As
a
result
of
these
new
developments
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
many
charities
and
pro
-
marijuana
organizations
have
intensified
their
research
into
the
use
of
the
plant
as
a
medical
drug
.
Observers
predict
that
the
full
legalization
of
the
plant
is
imminent
in
the
United
Kingdom
.

In
all
these
positive
developments
regarding
marijuana
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
the
Mainstream
Media
(
MSM
)
in
the
United
States
have
refused
to
report
on
them
.
Despite
the
news
being
published
by
many
British
media
outlets
,
in
the
United
States
,
the
corporate
MSM
have
pretended
not
to
have
heard
it
.
This
should
tell
us
that
there
is
a
grand
agenda
to
suppress
marijuana
in
the
United
States
,
with
the
help
of
the
corporate
media
,
in
order
to
prevent
people
from
benefiting
from
the
medicinal
value
of
the
obviously
wonderful
plant
;
pushing
the
agenda
of
favor
for
Big
Pharma
