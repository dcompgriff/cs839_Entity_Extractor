It
was
recently
announced
that
members
of
the
California
National
Guard
who
were
deployed
overseas
would
have
to
pay
back
enlistment
bonuses
to
the
government
.

The
troops
were
deployed
nearly
ten
years
ago
,
and
the
Pentagon
offered
bonuses
to
encourage
enlistment
.
Average
bonuses
were
around
$
15
,
000
.
However
,
it
turns
out
that
only
certain
enlisted
soldiers
in
specific
intelligence
,
civl
affairs
,
and
non
-
commissioned
officer
roles
were
eligible
for
these
bonuses
,
according
to
CNN
.

The
call
-
back
from
the
Pentagon
was
going
to
set
people
back
an
extraordinary
amount
of
money
,
dollars
that
these
people
had
come
to
depend
on
.
Because
of
the
government’s
mistakes
,
those
who
served
in
the
military
were
going
to
be
forced
to
give
that
money
back
.

However
,
the
Pentagon
is
issuing
a
reversal
of
that
order
.

Fox
News
reported
:

BRUSSELS
–
U
.
S
.
Defense
Secretary
Ash
Carter
has
ordered
the
Pentagon
to
stop
seeking
repayments
of
enlistment
bonuses
given
to
California
National
Guard
members
who
served
overseas
.

His
decision
comes
in
the
wake
of
angry
reaction
from
members
of
Congress
who
demanded
he
relieve
the
burden
on
the
Guard
members
.
And
the
White
House
said
President
Barack
Obama
has
warned
the
Defense
Department
not
to
“nickel
and
dime”
service
members
who
were
victims
of
fraud
by
overzealous
recruiters
.

In
a
statement
issued
during
a
meeting
of
defense
ministers
in
Brussels
,
Carter
said
effort
to
collect
reimbursement
should
stop
“as
soon
as
is
practical”
and
will
continue
until
a
process
to
help
the
troops
deal
with
the
problem
is
worked
out
.

It
is
a
good
thing
that
those
who
received
these
bonuses
are
not
being
forced
to
give
them
back
.
Granting
of
enlistment
bonuses
to
those
who
were
not
eligible
is
a
bad
mistake
that
is
the
fault
of
the
government
,
not
the
soldiers
being
deployed
.
The
soldiers
and
their
families
should
not
have
to
suffer
hardship
for
mistakes
made
by
top
Pentagon
officials
.

Unfortunately
,
this
is
just
the
latest
in
a
long
history
of
reckless
handling
of
finances
by
the
Pentagon
.
I
recently
reported
on
how
the
Pentagon
cannot
account
for
over
$
6
.
5
trillion
in
its
budget
.
That’s
trillion
with
a
T
.

Yet
where
is
the
outrage
?
It’s
almost
non
-
existent
.
Maybe
it’s
because
we
don’t
fathom
how
much
a
trillion
really
is
.

Nonetheless
,
the
Pentagon
needs
to
be
reined
in
.
Their
pattern
of
reckless
spending
is
not
one
that
can
be
tolerated
.
(
And
,
no
,
effectively
punishing
the
troops
for
top
officials’
mistakes
is
not
an
option
)
.
