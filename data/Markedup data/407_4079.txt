Now
that
the
FBI
has
obtained
the
needed
warrant
to
start
poring
over
the
650
,
000
or
so
emails
uncovered
in
Anthony
Weiner’s
notebook
,
among
which
thousands
of
emails
sent
from
Huma
Abedin
using
Hillary
Clinton’s
personal
server
,
moments
ago
the
US
Justice
Department
announced
it
is
also
joining
the
probe
,
and
as
AP
reported
moments
ago
,
vowed
to
dedicate
all
needed
resources
to
quickly
review
the
over
half
a
million
emails
in
the
Clinton
case
.

In
the
letter
to
Congress
,
the
DOJ
writes
that
it
“will
continue
to
work
closely
with
the
FBI
and
together
,
dedicate
all
necessary
resources
and
take
appropriate
steps
as
expeditiously
as
possible
,
”
assistant
attorney
General
Peter
J
.
Kadzik
writes
in
letters
to
House
and
Senate
lawmakers
.

So
far
so
good
,
even
if
one
wonders
just
how
active
the
DOJ
will
be
in
a
case
that
has
shown
an
unprecedented
schism
between
the
politically
influenced
Department
of
Justice
and
the
FBI
.

And
yet
,
something
felt
odd
about
this
.
Kadzik…
Kadzik…
where
have
we
heard
that
name
?

Oh
yes
.
Recall
our
post
from
last
week
,
“
Clinton
Campaign
Chair
Had
Dinner
With
Top
DOJ
Official
One
Day
After
Hillary’s
Benghazi
Hearing
”
in
which
we
reported
that
John
Podesta
had
dinner
with
one
of
the
highest
ranked
DOJ
officials
the
very
day
after
Hillary
Clinton’s
Benghazi
testimony
?

It
was
Peter
Kadzik
.
