For
weeks
,
the
mainstream
media
has
pushed
a
false
narrative
that
Hillary
Clinton
is
so
far
ahead
and
this
election
is
over
.
Luckily
,
there
are
some
who
realized
this
move
is
straight
out
of
the
leftist
playbook
and
called
out
the
press
for
what
they
were
up
to
—
lying
.
No
longer
can
they
report
Hillary
being
ahead
by
double
digits
.
In
what’s
been
dubbed
“the
monster
vote
,
”
here
are
the
poll
numbers
they
do
not
want
you
to
see
.

What’s
the
monster
vote
?
That’s
the
silent
majority
in
this
country
who
are
going
to
overwhelm
all
of
the
liberal
talking
heads’
expectations
.
We
started
to
see
the
monster
vote
for
Donald
Trump
in
the
primaries
,
where
he
attracted
voters
to
register
as
Republicans
to
vote
in
the
primaries
.

Now
,
we
have
early
voting
taking
place
in
some
states
,
and
those
numbers
are
proving
,
here
comes
the
monster
vote
.
Gateway

reported:

DONALD
TRUMP
Senior
Communications
Advisor
Jason
Miller
shared
some
very
positive
news
on
FOX
News
on
Sunday
morning
.

Jason
Miller
told
Melissa
Francis
the
Trump
Campaign
is
up
100
,
000
votes
in
Florida
and
35
,
000
votes
in
North
Carolina
compared
to
four
years
ago
.

“We’re
gonna
need

meme

Let’s
break
that
down
further
to
see
what
it
means
.
Based
on
all
the
early
voting
in
Florida
,
which
is
a
must
win
for
Trump
,
right
now
,
it’s
Trump
=
51
.
5
%
,
HRC
=
48
.
5
%
,
which
is
incredible
.
Democrats
typically
rule
early
voting
,
and
in
2012
,
at
this
point
,
Barack
Obama
was
up
by
5
%
in
Florida
.
Now
,
for
the
monster
vote
news
for
Florida
,
as
broken
down
by
The
Conservative
Treehouse
(
CTH
)
:

This
is
YUGE
because
Obama
won
early
voting
in
FL
by
5
points
in
2012
and
after
election
night
he
won
the
state
by
less
than
1
point
.

Actual
in
person
voting
on
the
traditional
election
day
,
November
8th
,
will
heavily
favor
Donald
Trump
.

Folks
,
based
on
what
we
have
data
wise
so
far
and
the
fact
that
the
16
counties
didn’t
start
early
voting
until
the
29th
of
October
(
which
favors
Trump
based
on
data
above
)
,
I
can
now
soundly
say
that
we
will
win
FL
by
8
to
10
points
(
54
.
5
–
46
.
5
)
.
The
monster
vote
is
coming
.

The
mainstream
media
will
continue
to
slant
the
early
voting
numbers
for
Hillary
,
so
don’t
listen
to
them
.
I
guarantee
you
,
they
are
taking
a
sample
and
then
skewing
it
.
Remember
,
Democrats
almost
always
vote
early
,
but
Republicans
don’t
usually
vote
until
election
day
.
Based
on
what
these
smart
guys
at
CTH
are
saying
,
North
Carolina
,
Ohio
,
and
Nevada
will
go
Trump
and
even
Minnesota
and
Wisconsin
are
slanting
towards
Trump
,
which
would
be
just
icing
on
the
cake
since
those
states
usually
go
Democrat
.

Tune
out
the
mainstream
media
on
the
polls
and
get
ready
for
the
monster
vote
.
It
seems
to
be
the
best
-
kept
secret
in
this
election
.
The
monster
voters
are
the
forgotten
men
and
women
across
this
country
who
haven’t
voted
in
years
and
are
now
sick
and
tired
of
Washington’s
corruption
invading
their
life
.

They’re
back
with
a
vengeance
,
and
they
have
hope
that
we
can
turn
this
country
around
.
We
all
agree
it
will
be
pure
joy
on
election
night
as
we
watch
Hillary
and
her
minions
break
down
in
disbelief
that
We
the
People
took
our
power
back
and
we
will
never
give
it
away
again
.
