Leave
it
to
that
pathetic
loser,
Anthony
Weiner,
to
mess
things
up
for
the
campaign
of
the
Democratic
presidential
nominee,
Hillary
Clinton.
I
bet
Huma
Abedin
is
kicking
herself
for
not
dumping
him
earlier.
The
FBI
Announcement

On
October
28,
2016,
FBI
Director
James
Comey
informed
Congress
that
the
Bureau
had
learned
of
new
emails
that
might
be
relevant
to
the
investigation
of
Hillary
Clinton’s
use
of
an
unauthorized
primate
email
server.

The
FBI
planned
to
review
the
emails
to
determine
whether
they
were
relevant
to
the
Clinton
case
and,
if
so,
how.
Comey
stated
that
the
agency
learned
of
the
emails
in
an
unrelated
criminal
case,
which
he
did
not
identify.

Naturally,
the
news
media
jumped
the
gun
and
concluded
that
the
Clinton
investigation
was
back
on.
And
just
as
naturally,
the
truth
was
not
so
simple.

Weiner
and
Clinton
Emails?

As
it
turns
out,
the
emails
that
concerned
the
FBI
were
found
on
a
device
owned
by
Anthony
Weiner.
Yes,
that
Anthony
Weiner,
the
one
who
couldn’t
keep
from
sexting
on
his
cell
phone.

He
is
the
estranged
husband
of
Huma
Abedin,
who
was
Hillary
Clinton’s
Chief
of
Staff
when
she
was
Secretary
of
State.
Abedin
remains
one
of
Clinton’s
closest
aides.
Abedin
announced
that
the
couple
were
separating
after
his
latest
sexting
scandal.

According
to
the
New
York
Times
,
the
FBI
was
investigating
text
messages
that
Weiner
allegedly
sent
to
a
15-year-old
girl
in
North
Carolina.
In
that
investigation,
the
FBI
examined
the
devices
and
computers
that
Weiner
used.
One
of
the
devices
also
contained
emails
that
the
FBI
determined
might
be
related
to
the
investigation
into
Secretary
Clinton’s
emails.
Not
A
Reopening



candidate
Donald
Trump
claims
that
Comey’s
letter
indicates
that
the
entire
investigation
into
Clinton’s
email
server
is
back
on.
They’re
salivating
over
the
possibility
that
Clinton’s
campaign
could
go
down
in
flames.
However,
that’s
not
what’s
happening
here.

Back
in
July,
Comey
testified
before
Congress
that
the
FBI
investigation
into
Clinton’s
email
server
was
complete
and
the
agency
did
not
recommend
that
anyone
be
charged
criminally.
He
also
said
that
Clinton
had
been
very
careless
with
classified
information.

His
October
28
letter
informs
Congress
that
the
FBI
will
examine
the
emails
found
on
Weiner’s
computer
to
determine
whether
they
contain
classified
information.
Comey
doesn’t
know
how
long
it
will
take
or
what
he
will
find.
What
Remains
The
Same

Still,
it’s
highly
unlikely
that
any
new
information
would
change
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
investigation.
After
all,
Comey
said
back
in
July
that
no
reasonable
prosecutor
would
bring
charges
against
Clinton
without
evidence
that
she
either
intentionally
or
recklessly
shared
classified
information.

Does
anyone
really
think
that
the
evidence
will
appear
on
Anthony
Weiner’s
computer?
