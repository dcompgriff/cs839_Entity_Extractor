Gambia
Joins
South
Africa
and
Burundi
in
Exodus
from
The
<[>International
Criminal
Court<]>

Gambia
has
announced
its
withdrawal
from
the
<[>International
Criminal
Court<]>
(
<[>ICC<]>
)
,
accusing
the
Hague
-
based
tribunal
of
the
“
persecution
and
humiliation
of
people
of
colour
,
especially
Africans
”
.

The
announcement
late
Tuesday
comes
after
similar
decisions
this
month
by
South
Africa
and
Burundi
to
abandon
the
troubled
institution
,
set
up
to
try
the
world’s
worst
crimes
.

Information
Minister
Sheriff
Bojang
said
in
an
announcement
on
state
television
that
the
court
had
been
used
“
for
the
persecution
of
Africans
and
especially
their
leaders
”
while
ignoring
crimes
committed
by
the
West
.

He
singled
out
the
case
of
former
British
prime
minister
Tony
Blair
,
who
the
<[>ICC<]>
decided
not
to
indict
over
the
Iraq
war
.

The
withdrawal
,
he
said
,
“
is
warranted
by
the
fact
that
the
<[>ICC<]>
,
despite
being
called
<[>International
Criminal
Court<]>
,
is
in
fact
an
<[>International
Caucasian
Court<]>
for
the
persecution
and
humiliation
of
people
of
colour
,
especially
Africans
”
.

The
<[>ICC<]>
,
set
up
in
2002
,
is
often
accused
of
bias
against
Africa
and
has
also
struggled
with
a
lack
of
cooperation
,
including
from
the
United
States
,
which
has
signed
the
court’s
treaty
but
never
ratified
it
.

Gambia
has
been
trying
without
success
to
use
the
court
to
punish
the
<[>European
Union<]>
for
deaths
of
thousands
of
African
migrants
trying
to
reach
its
shores
.

South
Africa’s
decision
followed
a
dispute
last
year
when
Sudanese
President
Omar
al
-
Bashir
visited
the
country
despite
being
the
subject
of
an
<[>ICC<]>
arrest
warrant
over
alleged
war
crimes
.

Earlier
this
month
,
Burundi
said
it
would
leave
the
court
,
while
Namibia
and
Kenya
have
also
raised
the
possibility
.
