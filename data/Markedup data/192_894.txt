Meant

Two
US
soldiers
and
four
Afghan
special
forces
were
killed
,
and
three
other
US
soldiers
wounded
in
heavy
fighting
with
the
Taliban
this
morning
,
as
the
Taliban
attempted
to
surge
into
an
area
around
the
northern
city
of
Kunduz
.
As
they
usually
do
,
the
troops
called
in
airstrikes
to
“break
the
siege
.
”

Instead
of
breaking
the
siege
,
the
US
warplanes
pounded
the
village
of
Bouz
Kandahari
,
destroying
a
number
of
houses
and
killing
at
least
30
civilians
.
25
further
civilians
were
wounded
in
the
attack
,
fueling
protests
outside
the
governor’s
office
in
Kunduz
.

NATO
conceded
immediately
that
the
coalition
was
behind
the
airstrikes
,
but
appeared
relatively
unrepentant
about
it
,
insisting
all
the
civilian
deaths
were
because
the
Taliban
were
using
the
houses
for
“cover
,
”
which
of
course
is
not
a
legal
justification
for
bombing
the
houses
.

US
commander
Gen
.
John
Nicholson
issued
a
statement
after
the
incidents
,
offering
condolences
to
the
families
of
the
two
US
soldiers
who
were
slain
.
Defense
Secretary
Ash
Carter
also
said
he
was
“saddened”
by
the
deaths
of
the
US
troops
,
but
neither
offered
much
of
anything
in
comments
on
the
dozens
of
dead
civilians
.
