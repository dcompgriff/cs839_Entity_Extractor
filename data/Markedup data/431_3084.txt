Some
of
you
may
wonder
and
ask
yourselves
WHY
has
the
FBI
reopened
the
the
Clinton
email
case
.
Anthony
Weiner
is
just
the
surface
reason
.
FBI
Director
James
Comey
saw
the
mutiny
within
the
FBI
with
many
FBI
agents
revolting
over
his
decision
not
to
prosecute
Hillary
Clinton
back
in
July
2016
.
So
here’s
the
bombshell:
Comey
decided
to
reopen
Hillary’s
email
investigation
because
he
is
fearing
that
he
will
get
arrested
and
put
behind
bars
for
corruption
and
collusion
in
case
Donald
Trump
wins
.
He
reopened
the
case
,
to
create
an
escape
route
in
case
Trump
wins
.
Its
quite
simple
actually
.
James
Comey
did
not
provide
any
recent
proof
he
stumbled
upon
and
neither
will
he
until
the
election
is
over
.
Yes
he’s
technically
not
allowed
to
but
he
could
just
indict
Hillary
in
a
second
if
he
truly
wanted
just
for
lying
to
the
FBI
or
wiping
the
server
to
get
rid
of
all
the
evidence
after
receiving
a
congressional
subpoena
.
So
if
Hillary
Clinton
wins
,
Comey
will
simply
close
the
case
and
declare
that
nothing
was
substantial
after
all
and
she
dust
made
a
mistake
,
just
like
he
did
before
.
If
Donald
Trump
wins
,
he
will
finalize
the
investigation
and
put
Hillary
Clinton
behind
bars
,
then
he
will
tell
Donald
Trump:
“See
?
I
was
fair
and
I
wasn’t
corrupt
!
I
DID
arrest
her
after
all
and
I
did
my
job
!
”
hoping
to
get
away
with
what
he
did
during
the
first
investigation
.
Make
no
mistake
about
it
,
this
isn’t
coincidence
,
Comey
surely
fears
Trump’s
retribution
,
the
decision
to
reopen
the
investigation
came
just
1
single
day
after
Trump
called
the
FBI
corrupt
and
called
for
a
reopening
of
the
investigation
,
see
for
yourself
.
Trump
is
pretty
tolerant
guy
so
this
may
actually
work
out
for
Comey
.
He
wrongfully
forgave
many
people
!
For
example
,
after
having
an
conflict
with
Paul
Ryan
refusing
to
endorse
Trump
back
in
the
primaries
,
Trump
finally
decided
to
forgive
Ryan
and
ENDORSE
him
right
before
the
Wisconsin
congress
elections
.
If
Trump
wasn’t
soft
regarding
some
of
those
traitors
,
he
would
have
endorsed
Paul
Nehlen
instead
but
he
didn’t
and
it
was
a
mistake
as
we
now
know
.
Comey
however
will
have
to
look
authentic
though
and
he
will
have
to
prove
to
Trump
BEFORE
the
elections
that
he
is
truly
on
to
something
and
that
this
isn’t
just
a
political
move
.
Don’t
expect
for
Comey
to
go
to
hard
because
he’s
well
aware
that
if
he
goes
too
hard
on
Queen
of
the
Underworld
Hillary
and
she
wins
,
then
he
will
rot
in
jail
for
the
rest
of
his
life
because
Hillary
is
the
revengeful
type
.
Just
to
prove
the
case
that
she
is
revengeful
,
look
at
what
she
did
after
Trump
slammed
Bill
Clinton
as
a
rapist
during
the
2nd
debate
.
Before
the
3rd
debate
even
started
,
she
paid
a
couple
of
skanks
to
go
out
and
publically
lie
,
falsely
accuse
Trump
of
raping
and
groping
them
.
During
the
2nd
debate
she
was
looking
at
Trump
with
hatred
while
he
was
speaking
and
she
was
looking
like
she
was
thinking
to
herself
things
similar
to
this:
“Ohh
yeah
?
F
*
*k
you
!
Wait
till
you
see
what
I’ll
do
to
you
next
time
!
You’re
gonna
regret
this
!
”
And
YES
she
was
even
seen
on
live
TV
telling
Trump
“F
*
*k
you
!
”
during
the
2nd
debate
.
Hillary
was
infuriated
because
Trump
brought
Bill’s
rape
victims
up
during
that
debate
,
but
most
people
didn’t
catch
it
!
She
was
clearly
infuriated
and
already
plotting
revenge
in
her
mind
.
So
with
that
said
,
don’t
expect
Hillary
Clinton
to
get
indicted
BEFORE
the
election
.
It’s
not
gonna
happen
.
Comey
is
a
weasel
appointed
by
Obama
.
Basically
he’s
a
Democrat
.
The
funny
thing
is
that
even
though
he’s
a
Democrat
in
disguise
,
fellow
Democrats
are
already
calling
Comey
“traitor”
,
“Russian
agent”
and
“Putin
puppet”
on
Twitter
.
Everyone
who
disagrees
with
them
must
be
a
Russian
agent
these
days
.
They
really
love
their
conspiracy
theories
.
After
all
isn’t
John
Podesta
interested
in
aliens
,
UFOs
and
Area
51
?
You
can’t
make
this
stuff
up
.
Really
funny
stuff
to
watch
those
crazy
liberals
going
full
psycho
.
But
even
if
Comey
is
playing
on
the
safe
side
with
both
candidates
,
Hillary
would
definitely
sink
her
fangs
into
his
neck
for
reopening
the
case
,
should
she
win
.
Even
if
he
does
NOTHING
and
just
closes
the
case
after
a
Hillary
victory
,
she
would
still
take
her
revenge
.
It’s
in
her
character
,
she’s
revengeful
and
besides
its
a
classic
mafia
tactic
,
leave
no
traitor
alive
or
among
your
ranks
.
She
would
at
the
very
least
replace
him
.
Additionally
Comey
wanted
to
calm
down
an
FBI
which
was
facing
a
full
pitchfork
revolution
from
within
with
many
agents
being
angered
by
this
.
Jill
McCabe
,
the
wife
of
the
FBI
deputy
director
Andrew
McCabe
who
investigated
Hillary
Clinton
,
received
a
$
675
.
000
“donation”
(
bribe
)
from
Hillary
Clinton
.
The
agents
were
angry
.
So
this
move
to
reopen
the
case
was
also
strategic
with
his
agents
.
It
will
calm
the
waters
down
for
a
while
.
If
Hillary
wins
he
will
just
tell
the
agents
to
go
F
themselves
and
look
for
a
another
job
if
they
don’t
like
it
,
if
Trump
wins
and
Comey
indicts
Hillary
after
the
election
,
the
other
agents
will
be
pleased
.
Hillary
probably
has
something
on
Comey
on
which
she
could
blackmail
him
with
but
it
won’t
matter
because
IF
he
will
do
his
job
and
arrest
Hillary
shortly
after
the
election
,
Trump
will
be
pleased
and
keep
him
on
as
the
director
.
James
Comey
would
prefer
Hillary
to
win
though
because
that’s
why
he
didn’t
indict
her
during
the
first
investigation
,
but
he’s
gotta
defend
his
ass
by
preparing
for
a
different
scenario
,
like
a
Trump
victory
so
that’s
exactly
why
he
reopened
the
investigation
now
.
Trump
will
win
in
a
landslide
and
Comey
will
most
likely
be
fine
should
he
prove
himself
worthy
before
the
election
and
actually
do
something
.
Expect
more
of
those
two
-
faced
people
to
come
out
and
do
the
same
in
the
next
days
.
Expect
event
he
likes
of
CNN
,
New
York
Times
to
stop
bashing
Trump
as
everyone
will
have
to
prepare
for
the
possibility
of
a
Trump
victory
,
out
of
fear
of
a
huge
retribution
in
case
they
don’t
change
.
Remember
those
libel
laws
CNN
?
