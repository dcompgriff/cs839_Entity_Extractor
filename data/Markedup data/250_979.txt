Reddit
users
(also
known
as
redditors)
are
growing
increasingly
angry
at
pro-Hillary
Clinton
political
action
committee
(PAC)
Correct
The
Record
over
its
efforts
to
promote
a
pro-Hillary
narrative
on
the
site.

Redditors
are
especially
concerned
that
Correct
The
Record’s
paid
internet
commenters
are
suppressing
revelations
from
WikiLeaks’
release
of
Clinton
campaign
chair
John
Podesta’s
emails,
which
have
produced
a
flood
of
damaging
revelations
about
the
Clinton
campaign.

Reddit,
which
describes
itself
as
“a
source
for
what’s
new
and
popular
on
the
web”
is
divided
into
thousands
of
“subreddits,”
which
the
site
describes
as
“sub-communities,
each
focused
on
a
specific
topic.”

Whether
or
not
a
post
does
well
on
Reddit
(and,
consequently,
how
large
of
an
audience
it
reaches)
largely
depends
on
how
many
“upvotes”
and
“downvotes”
it
receives.
