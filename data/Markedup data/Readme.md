This includes political parties, universities, companies, websites, and other directly named social organizations. It does NOT include person names, locations, devices or named instruments.

If an entity spans multiple lines, the the opening tag <[> is placed before the first word of the entity (But on the same line, with no space between the tag and the word), and after the last word of the entity (But on the same line, with no space between the tag and the word).
