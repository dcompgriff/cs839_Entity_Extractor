Even
during
the
stage
of
production,
Alexei
Mizgirev’s
The
Duelist
caught
the
attention
of
the
international
cinema
industry.
The
world
premiere
of
the
movie
was
held
the
Toronto
Film
Festival
and,
in
collaboration
with
IMAX,
the
film
is
being
released
in
the
U.S.
and
other
countries.

Before
The
Duelist,
Mizgirev
was
considered
to
be
only
a
“festival”
director
in
Russia
–
all
his
previous
pictures
had
gone
out
on
limited
release,
and
were
seen
by
only
a
few
thousand
people.
However,
suddenly,
in
cooperation
with
producer
Alexander
Rodnyansky
(
Jayne
Mansfield’s
Car
,
Cloud
Atlas
,
Leviathan
),
he
has
made
one
of
the
most
expensive
projects
in
the
history
of
Russian
cinema.

Set
in
the
1860s,
The
Duelist
is
a
costume
drama
about
a
killer,
the
officer
Yakovlev,
who
engages
in
duels
for
other
people.
For
some
mystical
reason
bullets
cannot
kill
him,
so
he
always
wins
his
duels.

Before
the
film
released,
Mizgirev
spoke
to
RIR
about
his
new
film.

RIR:
How
does
it
feel,
after
directing
only
low-budget
auteur
films,
to
be
a
director
of
a
film
that
cost
such
a
large
amount
of
money,
going
by
standards
of
the
Russian
film
industry?

Alexei
Mizgirev:
People
ask
me
this
a
lot.
At
first
I
was
a
bit
lost
and
didn’t
know
how
to
answer,
because
I
hadn’t
really
noticed
a
big
difference.
With
The
Duelist
we
had
no
problems,
for
example
with
decoration
and
costume,
because
we
could
shoot
where
we
wanted
and
didn’t
have
to
save
on
props.
I
was
now
rid
of
many
problems
that
had
cropped
up
in
previous
films,
because
the
producers
were
able
to
solve
them
perfectly.

This
was
all
very
pleasant.
However
such
changes
indirectly
affect
the
creative
process.
We
were
constantly
discussing
points
to
work
on,
but
it
was
all
very
democratic,
because
we
both
understood
that
there
are
mass-produced,
cookie-cutter
films,
and
others
that
are
single,
unique
pieces.
The
Duelist
is
a
unique
film,
in
which
individuality
and
the
author’s
style
is
important
–
with
the
background
of
a
great
story
and
modern
visual
effects,
of
course.

RIR:
All
your
preceding
films
have
been
about
acute
social
issues
in
modern
Russian
life.
And
here
we
have
balls,
costumes,
duels,
and
nobles
in
waistcoats.
Where
has
this
interest
in
this
period
come
from?

A.M.:
Any
director
wants
millions
of
people
to
watch
his
films.
But
when
you’re
given
a
budget
of
$1-2
million,
it’s
difficult
to
create
beautiful
and
spectacular
cinema
.
You
would
like
to,
but
it’s
impossible
for
objective
reasons.
Therefore,
an
interest
in
contemporary
affairs
is
in
some
respects
necessary,
simply
because
you
don’t
have
to
waste
money
on
expensive
decorations
and
computer
effects.

The
concept
of
The
Duelist
has
already
been
in
the
works
for
several
years,
it
was
just
lying
somewhere,
literally
two
paragraphs
long.
And
then
something
happened,
and
I
thought
to
myself,
this
needs
to
happen
now.
Even
though
realizing
this
idea
was
very
far
off,
I
already
thought
then
that
the
biggest
problem
I’d
have
with
it
would
not
be
to
do
with
finance.

RIR:
What
sort
of
difficulties
are
you
talking
about?

A.M.:
I
am
talking
about
the
19
th
century
itself,
or
rather,
its
image,
which
is
difficult
to
portray
in
audiovisual
art.
You
probably
won’t
disagree
that
Russian
viewers
only
know
about
the
19
th
century
from
TV
series,
since
the
last
proper
film
made
for
the
big
screen
was
[Vladimir
Motyl’s]
The
Captivating
Star
of
Happiness
,
shot
in
1975.
But
even
this
film
was
riddled
with
a
mass
of
clichés
and
openly
mistaken
information
about
the
19
th
century.

A
common
film
market
for
Russia,
India
and
China?

When
I
was
preparing
for
The
Duelist
I
sifted
through
a
mass
of
sources
on
this
period.
It
turns
out
that
we
don’t
really
know
anything
about
them,
what
they
really
ate,
drank,
talked
about,
and
how
they
really
dressed,
apart
from
some
pleasant
misconceptions
we
have.
The
19
th
century
for
the
contemporary
viewer
is
a
load
of
old
mothballs
at
granny’s
place
or
some
sedate
play
from
a
provincial
theatre.

I’d
like
to
get
rid
of
this
stereotype
and
show
this
period
like
no
one
else
has
done
–
bright,
harsh,
echoing
with
our
times.
This
is
of
course
a
grandiose
task,
but
I’m
not
afraid
of
the
work,
or
the
public
reaction
to
this
new
style
of
discussion
about
the
past.
This
is
a
complete
breaking
of
the
mould.

RIR:
However
the
visual
style
of
The
Duelist
has
several
times
been
compared
to
Sherlock
Holmes
by
Guy
Ritchie
and
the
film
Vidoqc
by
Pitof.
Do
you
like
having
such
parallels
with
your
work?

A.M.:
Such
comparisons
have
a
lot
of
truth
in
them.
However
this
is
a
very
decorative
work,
a
celebration
of
the
genre
in
its
purest
form.
The
Duelist
is
a
little
different,
including
if
we
talk
about
its
visual
effects.

RIR:
With
The
Duelist
,
everyone
asks
you
about
the
idea
of
honour,
which
is
the
main
trigger
for
the
film.
You
answer,
expectedly,
that
honour
is
a
timeless
thing,
and
for
this
reason
a
story
about
this
will
always
resound
with
the
present.
But
it
seems
in
your
film
fatalism
plays
just
as
important
a
role,
one
which
is
peculiar
to
the
film’s
characters.
We’re
guessing
that
this
emphasis
on
the
doomed
characters’
relationship
with
fate
is
not
an
accidental
one?

A.M.:
Yes,
this
is
one
of
the
driving
forces
of
the
film.
Delving
into
stories
about
duels,
I
stumbled
across
an
eloquent
fact.
In
the
19
th
century,
in
the
birthplace
of
duels,
France,
they
practically
disappeared,
like
in
many
other
countries.
This
is
linked
to
the
spread
of
firearms,
which
were
far
more
dangerous
than
swords
and
which
greatly
levelled
the
playing
field.

For
exactly
this
reason,
duels
flourished
in
Russia,
I
think
for
the
most
part
thanks
to
fatalism,
which
to
this
day
remains
as
one
of
the
principle
characteristics
of
the
Russian
mentality.
Sink
or
swim
–
it
is
very
much
our
thing,
even
if
we
are
talking
about
life
and
death.
The
Duelist
is
precisely
about
this.
