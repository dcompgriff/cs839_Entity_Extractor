Over
100
fighter
jets,
long-range
bombers
and
combat
helicopters
have
been
scrambled
at
their
bases
across
Russia
and
six
post-Soviet
states
as
the
allies
prepare
to
test
their
integrated
air
defense
system
in
a
massive
military
exercise.
More
than
130
command
and
control
centers
have
been
put
on
alert
in
Russia
and
six
former
Soviet
republics
-
Armenia,
Belarus,
Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan
and
Uzbekistan
-
the
Russian
Defense
Ministry
said
in
a
statement
on
Wednesday.
All
the
countries
contribute
to
the
integrated
air
defense
system
overseen
by
the
Commonwealth
of
Independent
States
(CIS)
-
an
alliance
of
former
Soviet
republics
that
emerged
after
the
collapse
of
the
USSR.
The
large-scale
military
exercise
is
to
train
high-readiness
forces
in
dealing
with
"airspace
violations,
including
by
hijacked
aircraft"
as
well
as
"assisting
crews
of
aircraft
in
distress,"
the
ministry
added.
Some
100
aircraft,
including
Su-27,
MiG-29
and
MiG-31
fighter
jets,
Su-24
and
Su-34
bombers,
as
well
as
Su-25
ground
attack
jets
and
combat
helicopters
provided
by
the
allies,
are
expected
to
take
part
in
the
drill.
Troops
from
electronic
warfare
and
surface-to-air
missile
units
are
also
participating.
The
exercise
started
at
8am
Moscow
time
with
Tu-160,
Tu-95MS
and
Tu-22M3
aircraft
given
the
roles
of
aggressor.
The
planes,
simulating
an
adversary
force,
were
spotted
over
Eastern
European
and
Central
Asian
airspaces,
the
Russian
military
said.
All
units
are
being
coordinated
from
a
Russian
Air
Force
command
center
located
outside
Moscow.
The
joint
CIS
air
defense
system,
established
in
1995,
currently
focuses
on
protecting
the
ex-Soviet
countries'
airspace
as
well
as
providing
air
or
missile
strike
early
warnings
and
coordinated
responses.
Russia
contributes
the
bulk
of
the
system's
early
warning
and
air
defense
capacities,
with
short-
and
long-range
radar
stations
monitoring
the
area.
Notably,
the
system
does
not
have
a
single
commander.
It
is
collectively
controlled
by
the
chiefs
of
the
air
defense
forces
of
the
member
states
themselves.
Bilateral
air
defense
systems
between
Russia
and
its
neighbors
have
also
been
established
in
recent
years.
Last
December,
an
air
defense
agreement
between
Russia
and
Armenia
was
signed
by
the
two
countries'
defense
ministers,
Sergey
Shoigu
and
Seyran
Oganyan,
respectively.
In
2013
Moscow
signed
a
separate
treaty
on
a
joint
regional
air
defense
system
with
Kazakhstan.
Russian
and
Belarusian
anti-aircraft
missile
forces
have
already
been
unified
into
an
integrated
system
designed
to
contain
any
security
threats
in
the
European
theater.
