Project
Veritas
continues
with
it’s
series
of
videos
–
this
time
an
undercover
reporter
exposed
early
Clinton
email
witness
Cindy
Almodovar.
In
the
video,
Cindy
Almodovar
–
who
spoke
with
Huma
Abedin
about
email
issues
that
were
going
on
–
admits
that
the
FBI
didn’t
interview
her.
In
December
2010,
U.S.
Department
of
State
IT
Systems
Administrator
Cindy
Almodovar
reported
that
she
met
with
Huma
Abedin
for
thirty
minutes
regarding
emails
at
the
then
unknown,
but
now
notorious,
@
clintonemail.com
site.
Here’s
is
the
text
from
that
email
exchange:

Meeting
with
Huma
I
met
with
Huma
for
about
30
minutes
to
go
over
mail
issues.
She
gave
me
some
examples
listed
below,
but
also,
things
are
inconsistent.
But
issue
#1
is
of
an
e-mail
which
was
sent
to
her
twice
this
morning,
did
get
received
on
<REDACTED>
but
was
not
delivered.
See
details
below.
I
have
a
contact
for
the
@clintonemail
site,
his
name
is
Bryan
Pagliano
and
he
actually
now
works
for
State,
but
he
apparently
set
all
of
this
up.
Huma
sent
several
tests
from
her
clintonemail
account
to
Lona
and
myself
–
they
were
received.
But
there
are
many
messages
and
responses
not
received.
She
sent
a
message
this
morning
from
her
state.gov
account
to
cheftwan@mail.house.gov.On
12/14,
hdr22@clintonemail.com
sent
a
message
to
huma@clintonemail.com
and
Valmoroli@state.gov
at
10:03
pm
.
The
subject
line
was
blank.
Huma
received
at
Clinton
address,
but
Lona
did
not
receive
on
her
state.gov
account.”
As
a
result
of
subsequent
investigations
regarding
Secretary
Hillary
Clinton’s
use
of
a
private
email
server,
the
Office
of
Inspector
General
for
the
U.S.
State
Department
reported
the
following:
From
the
unclassified
May
2016
State
Department
report
ESP-16-03:
Two
staff
in
S/ES-IRM
reported
to
OIG
that,
in
late
2010,
they
each
discussed
their
concerns
about
Secretary
Clinton’s
use
of
a
personal
email
account
in
separate
meetings
with
the
then-Director
of
S/ES-IRM.
In
one
meeting,
one
staff
member
raised
concerns
that
information
sent
and
received
on
Secretary
Clinton’s
account
could
contain
Federal
records
that
needed
to
be
preserved
in
order
to
satisfy
Federal
recordkeeping
requirements.
According
to
the
staff
member,
the
Director
stated
that
the
Secretary’s
personal
system
had
been
reviewed
and
approved
by
Department
legal
staff
and
that
the
matter
was
not
to
be
discussed
any
further.
As
previously
noted,
OIG
found
no
evidence
that
staff
in
the
Office
of
the
Legal
Adviser
reviewed
or
approved
Secretary
Clinton’s
personal
system.
According
to
the
other
S/ES-IRM
staff
member
who
raised
concerns
about
the
server,
the
Director
stated
that
the
mission
of
S/ES-IRM
is
to
support
the
Secretary
and
instructed
the
staff
never
to
speak
of
the
Secretary’s
personal
email
system
again.
The
director
referred
in
the
OIG
report
is
John
Bentel.
In
2010,
he
was
the
State
Department
employee
who
managed
IT
security
issues
for
the
top
echelon
of
the
department.
He
told
FBI
investigators
those
conversations
back
in
2010
never
occurred.
In
March
of
2016,
Bentel
refused
to
answer
questions
from
Senate
investigators
and
asserted
his
Fifth
Amendment
right
87
times
during
a
deposition
for
a
civil
lawsuit
related
to
Hillary
Clinton’s
use
of
a
private
email
server.”
Here’s
a
transcript
of
the
exchange
between
Project
Veritas’s
journalist
and
Cindy
Almodovar.
PV
Journalist:
I’m
working
on
a
story.
I’m
interested.
I
want
to
know
the
truth
and
I
want
to
know
if
you’re
one
of
the
people
who
came,
who
went
to
John
Bentel
and
said
they
were
concerned
about
Hillary’s
private
server.
Almodovar:
I
don’t
know
anything
about
that.
PV
Journalist:
You
weren’t
involved
in
that
at
all?
Almodovar:
You’ve
got
to
stop
this
because
this
is
like
harassment.
PV
Journalist:
This
will
be
the
last
time
you
see
me.
I
just
want
to
know
the
truth.
I’m
interested.
I
want
to
know
if
the
FBI
has
talked
to
you.
Almodovar:
No
they
haven’t.
PV
Journalist:
They
haven’t
at
all…
…PV
Journalist:
I’m
sure
reporters
and
people
have
been
coming
to
your
door.
Almodovar:
No.
No
one
has
come
to
the
door.
You’re
the
first
one.
“Even
though
her
name
stands
out
in
the
emails
released
by
the
FBI,
no
one
from
the
FBI
ever
spoke
to
Aldomovar,”
said
Project
Veritas
Action
founder
James
O’Keefe.
“No
one
interviewed
her
or
made
any
attempt
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
information
she
might
have
about
this
case
that
is
so
important
to
national
security.
It
made
us
wonder…who
else
the
FBI
neglected
to
talk
with.”
