From
the
first
piece
headlined
James
Comey
is
damaging
our
democracy
:

First
,
the
FBI
director
,
James
B
.
Comey
,
put
himself
enthusiastically
forward
as
the
arbiter
of
not
only
whether
to
prosecute
a
criminal
case
—
which
is
not
the
job
of
the
FBI
—
but
also
best
practices
in
the
handling
of
email
and
other
matters
.
Now
,
he
has
chosen
personally
to
restrike
the
balance
between
transparency
and
fairness
,
departing
from
the
department’s
traditions
.

From
the
second
piece
by
notorious
mud
-
slinger
Dana
Milbank:

I’ve
long
believed
in
Comey’s
integrity
.
But
if
he
doesn’t
step
forward
and
explain
his
October
Surprise
,
he
may
inadvertently
wind
up
interfering
in
the
political
process
—
perhaps
even
reversing
the
outcome
of
a
presidential
election
—
in
a
way
that
would
have
made
J
.
Edgar
Hoover
gape
.

And
the
third
strike
:

FBI
Director
James
B
.
Comey’s
stunning
announcement
that
he
has
directed
investigators
to
begin
reviewing
new
evidence
in
the
Clinton
email
investigation
was
yet
another
troubling
violation
of
long
-
standing
Justice
Department
rules
or
precedent
,
conduct
that
raises
serious
questions
about
his
judgment
and
ability
to
serve
as
the
nation’s
chief
investigative
official
.

Back
to
the
July
7
editorial:

“It
appears
damage
is
being
done
to
the
rule
of
law
,
”
Mr
.
Ryan
said
.
He’s
right
,
but
the
FBI
director
isn’t
doing
the
damage
.
The
wreckers
are
those
who
cast
baseless
aspersions
on
U
.
S
.
law
enforcement
in
the
service
of
their
partisan
goals
.

I
for
one
believe
that
Comey
was
wrong
in
July
and
is
right
today
.
He
should
have
pressed
for
charges
against
Clinton
early
on
.
Using
a
“secret”
private
email
server
for
confidential
state
business
is
not
legal
and
would
have
been
out
of
bounds
for
anyone
else
.
Now
possible
new
evidence
was
found
and
must
be
investigated
.
It
is
not
Comey’s
job
to
ask
if
the
timing
of
a
renewed
investigation
is
convenient
for
the
potential
culprit
.
He
also
had
to
inform
Congress
because
he
had
reasonably
promised
to
do
so
.
(
He
also
needed
to
save
his
ass
before
anyone
else
in
his
department
talked
to
the
media
.
)

The
so
called
“election”
of
a
U
.
S
.
president
is
always
a
sorry
show
.
But
this
season’s
version
has
at
least
some
amusing
moments
.
Seeing
the
hypocrites
at
Fred
Hyatt’s
Funny
Pages™
squirm
is
one
of
them
.
It
makes
me
smirk
.
