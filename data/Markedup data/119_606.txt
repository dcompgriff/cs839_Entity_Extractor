Unveils
Update
of
Advanced
Nuclear
Weapon

Russia
has
unveiled
a
new
nuclear
missile
that
“is
capable
of
wiping
out
parts
of
the
earth
the
size
of
Texas
or
France.”

Reports
say
that
the
RS-28
missile,
dubbed
the
“Satan
2,”
was
unveiled
this
week,
with
the
first
image
of
the
weapon
being
released
to
the
public
by
designers
at
the
Makeyev
Rocket
Design
Bureau
.
It’s
also
known
as
“Sarmat”
in
Russian.

The
report
comes
as
Moscow
has
been
flexing
its
military
muscle
amid
tensions
with
the
United
States
over
the
war
in
Syria
and
lingering
fallout
from
the
invasion
of
Crimea
in
Ukraine.
NATO,
meanwhile,
has
been
shoring
up
its
defenses
in
countries
near
Russia’s
border
amid
concerns
about
its
military
direction.

“The
prospective
strategic
missile
system
is
being
developed
in
order
to
assuredly
and
effectively
fulfill
objectives
of
nuclear
deterrent
by
Russia’s
strategic
forces,”
according
to
a
statement
from
V.
Degtar
and
Y.
Kaverin,
listed
as
the
bomb’s
chief
designer
and
leading
designer,
respectively,
reported
RT
,
a
Russian
government-funded
news
site.

Earlier
this
year,
the
Kremlin-aligned
Sputnik
News
website
said
the
missile
could
“wipe
out”
portions
of
the
earth
the
“size
of
Texas
or
France.”

The
RS-28
will
replace
the
R-36,
which
was
called
the
“SS-18
Satan”
by
NATO
when
it
was
introduced
in
the
1970s.

Robert
Kelley,
a
former
nuclear
weapons
expert
at
the
U.S.
Department
of
Energy,
told
NBC
News
that
the
new
missile
most
likely
had
an
upgrade
in
the
device’s
electronics,
rather
than
an
increase
in
its
explosive
payload
or
range.

“The
range
of
the
missiles
will
be
about
the
same,
the
explosive
destructive
power
will
be
about
the
same
[but]
the
reliability,
flexibility
and
confidence
[in
the
warheads’
ability
to
hit
their
targets]
will
go
way
up,”
said
Kelley.

He
noted:
“Your
iPhone
can
do
thousands
of
more
things
today
than
in
the
1970s
when
these
systems
were
first
deployed.
Many
of
the
clunky
electronic
circuits
of
that
era
no
longer
exist
and
no
one
knows
how
to
make
them
anymore.”

The
RS-28
weighs
about
100
tons,
and
it
features
a
large,
10-ton
nuclear
payload
capacity.
The
missile
is
expected
to
enter
service
in
2018.
