Rapper
Kanye
West
has
come
out
in
support
of
Republican
President
-
elect
Donald
Trump
,
drawing
boos
and
whistles
from
fans
.

Kanye
West
has
always
been
something
of
a
provocateur
and
a
nihilist
,
and
is
staunchly
anti
-
political
correctness
.

Last
night
he
stirred
a
maybe
unprecedented
level
of
controversy
,
however
,
declaring
at
a
Saint
Pablo
Tour
show
in
San
Jose:
“I
would
have
voted
on
Trump”
.
West
told
the
audience
at
a
concert
in
San
Jose
,
California
on
Thursday
night
that
he
didn’t
vote
in
the
Nov
.
8
U
.
S
.
presidential
elections
“but
if
I
would
have
voted
,
I
would
have
voted
for
Trump
.
”

“This
is
my
platform
and
I’m
going
to
talk
about
the
paradigm
shift
that’s
happening
right
now
,
”
he
said
at
the
top
of
a
40
-
minute
political
speech
that
came
at
the
cost
of
several
songs
.

It’s
hard
to
ascertain
exactly
the
point
he
was
trying
to
make
as
we
only
have
tweets
and
videos
from
attendees
,
not
a
transcript
,
to
go
off
,
but
it
sounds
as
though
he
was
mostly
praising
the
disruptive
nature
of
Trump’s
campaign
,
which
‘inspired
racists
to
reveal
themselves’
.

would’ve
voted

“Whether
you
voted
for
Hillary
or
Trump
,
this
is
a
safe
space
for
both
of
you
,
”
he
told
the
audience
,
asking
any
Trump
voters
to
make
themselves
known
.
He
also
reiterated
his
desire
to
run
for
president
in
2020
,
saying
his
focus
would
be
on
education
and
that
his
campaign
would
use
a
different
political
model
.

“Stop
focusing
on
racism
,
”
he
added
,
declaring
sombrely:
“We
are
in
a
racist
country
–
period
.
”
His
stance
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
2005
Kanye
,
who
famously
declared
that
“George
Bush
doesn’t
care
about
black
people”
in
the
wake
of
the
devestating
Hurricane
Katrina
.

The
concert
received
an
understandably
mixed
response
.

Kanye
was
apparently
happy
when
one
woman
screamed
that
she
loved
him
in
spite
of
his
appreciation
of
Trump’s
campaign
,
but
there
was
also
a
lot
of
booing
,
stunned
silence
and
even
a
few
projectiles
–
one
of
which
was
a
Yeezy
shoe
,
which
Kanye
promptly
signed
and
returned
to
the
thrower
.
