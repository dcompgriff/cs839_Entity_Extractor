The
fight
against
the
Dakota
Access
Pipeline
isn’t
only
about
water
rights

sacred
sites

it’s
also
about
the
U

government’s
historical
refusal
to
honor
treaties—when
“
they
interfered
with
Manifest
Destiny
.
”
Washington
violated
its
treaty
with
the
Sioux
in
1877
,
and
later
declared
its

to

all
Native
treaties

When
activists
talk
about
the
controversial
Dakota
Access
Pipeline
[
1
]
and
the
Native
uprising
surrounding
its
construction
,
they
often
frame
it
with
regard
to
the
environment
.
Water
.
Sacred
burial
grounds
.
Grandmother

.

Opponents
site
potential
environmental
risks
to
water
resources
like
the
Missouri
and
Mississippi
rivers
to
defend
their
stance
against
the
1
,
172
-
mile
long
pipeline
,
which
would
have
the
capacity
to
transport
up
to
570
,
000
barrels
of
crude
oil
a
day
from
the
Bakken
oilfields
of
North
Dakota
to
markets
across
the
U
.
S
.

What
many
ignore
,
however
,
is
another
facet
of
the
#
<[>NoDAPL<]>
[
2
]
movement
:
Native
sovereignty
.

Most
of
the
confrontations
between
water
protectors
and
law
enforcement
are
occurring
near
the
Standing
Rock
Reservation
.
The
reservation
currently
takes
up
roughly
3
,
625
square
miles
[
3
]
across
southeastern
North
Dakota
and
into
South
Dakota
.
More
than
8
,
000
people
[
4
]
live
in
scattered
communities
,
all
connected
by
a
common
history—one
which
includes
land
theft
and
treaty
violations
.

The
construction
of
the
Dakota
Access
Pipeline
has
brought
this
history
to
the
current
day
.
“
Our
standoff
is
on
treaty
land
,
so
we
have
every
right
to
defend
what
is
rightfully
ours
,
”
says
Cody
Hall
,
a
Lakota
civil
rights
activist
with
the
<[>Cheyenne
River
Tribe<]>
who
has
spent
time
on
the
frontlines
in
North
Dakota
.

When
he
speaks
of
“
treaty
land
,
”
he’s
referring
to
land
allotted
to
the
<[>Great
Sioux
Nation<]>
by
the
Treaty
of
Fort
Laramie
of
1851
and
1868
.

“
Our
standoff
is
on
treaty
land
,
so
we
have
every
right
to
defend
what
is
rightfully
ours
.
”

The
revised
treaty
established
the
Great
Sioux
Reservation
in
1868
,
which
the
federal
governement
would
eventually
shrink
to
what
became
the
Standing
Rock
Reservation
.
The
treaty
land
crisscrossed
between
seven
present
-
day
states—North
Dakota
,
South
Dakota
,
Nebraska
,
Kansas
,
Colorado
,
Wyoming
and
Montana—including
the
reservation
and
unceded
territories
reserved
for
hunting
.

These
boundaries
were
created
to
ensure
peace
between
Native
people
and
colonizers
.
The
temptations
of
gold
,
however
,
meant
that
travelers
were
soon
in
tribal
territory
.
Almost
immediately
after
its
conception
in
1851
,
the
U
.
S
.
violated
the
treaty
by
not
policing
its
citizens'
entry
onto
Native
land
.

For
Native
Americans
,
treaties
function
as
the
law
of
the
land
.
Article
VI
of
the
U
.
S
.
Constitution
clearly
states
:

This
Constitution
,
and
the
laws
of
the
United
States
which
shall
be
made
in
pursuance
thereof
;
and
all
treaties
made
,
or
which
shall
be
made
,
under
the
authority
of
the
United
States
,
shall
be
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
;
and
the
judges
in
every
state
shall
be
bound
thereby
,
anything
in
the
Constitution
or
laws
of
any
State
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
.

The
U
.
S
.
government
would
honor
treaties—until
they
interfered
with
Manifest
Destiny
.
“
It
was
all
about
colonial
expansion
,
”
says
Frank
Pommersheim
,
a
professor
at
the
<[>University
of
South
Dakota
School
of
Law<]>
who
specializes
in
Indian
law
.
In
1877
,
without
consent
from
the
Sioux
,
the
United
States
stole
their
sacred
Black
Hills
.
The
land
was
the
center
of
their
world
,
their
birthplace
.

This
act
set
in
stone
U
.
S
.
-
tribal
relations
.
From
then
on
,
the
United
States
slowly
diminished
the
land
it
left
for
tribal
peoples
.
By
1889
,
the
Great
Sioux
Reservation
became
what
it
is
today
:
3
,
625
square
miles
tucked
between
North
and
South
Dakota
,
stripped
of
ancestral
burial
grounds
and
lush
buffalo
populations
with
which
the
Sioux
used
to
coexist
.

In
1903
,
fewer
than
30
years
after
the
Black
Hills
seizement
,
the
<[>Supreme
Court<]>
ruled
in
Lone
Wolf
v
.
Hitchcock
[
5
]
that
<[>Congress<]>
may
unilaterally
break
treaties
between
the
U
.
S
.
and
Native
Americans
using
its
plenary
power
.
“
It
is
unfortunately
a
part
of
American
law
.
That
basic
precept
is
totally
unacceptable
to
Native
people
in
the
context
of
treaties
,
”
Pommersheim
explains
.
"
It
is
just
a
collision
between
cultures
and
different
understandings
and
interpretation
of
what
treaties
actually
mean
.
"

“
Almost
immediately
after
its
conception
in
1851
,
the
U
.
S
.
violated
the
treaty
by
not
policing
its
citizens'
entry
onto
Native
land
.
”

He
is
correct
that
a
vast
number
of
Native
Americans
find
this
unacceptable
.

“
To
us
[
these
treaties
]
are
very
much
still
alive
and
a
part
of
our
everyday
life
,
”
says
Remi
Bald
Eagle
,
the
intergovernmental
affairs
coordinator
for
the
<[>Cheyenne
River
Sioux
Tribe<]>
in
South
Dakota
.
“
We
still
honor
those
treaties
,
and
I
know
the
chairman
has
said
that
he
expects
America
to
do
the
same
.
”

And
while
the
U
.
S
.
has
violated
said
treaties
over
the
past
century
,
it’s
never
declared
the
treaties
null
or
void
,
Bald
Eagle
adds
.

With
the
Treaty
of
Fort
Laramie
in
mind
,
water
protectors
opposing
the
Dakota
Access
Pipeline
have
tried
to
take
action
.
On
October
23
,
pipeline
opponents
declared
eminent
domain
[
6
]
over
land
owned
by
<[>Energy
Transfer<]>
,
the
company
behind
the
pipeline
,
by
citing
the
treaty
.
Joye
Braun
,
an
Indigenous
Environmental
Network
organizer
,
said
in
a
statement
:

We
have
never
ceded
this
land
.
If
DAPL
can
go
through
and
claim
eminent
domain
on
landowners
and
Native
peoples
on
their
own
land
,
then
we
as
sovereign
nations
can
then
declare
eminent
domain
on
our
own
aboriginal
homeland
.
We
are
here
to
protect
the
burial
sites
here
.
Highway
1806
has
become
the
no
surrender
line
.

The
<[>Sacred
Ground
Camp<]>
had
already
existed
for
over
a
month
with
about
300
people
camped
out
,
but
occupiers
extended
the
camp
on
October
23
by
creating
three
road
blockades
to
prevent
militarized
law
enforcement
from
entering
.
(
This
came
just
a
day
after
police
arrested
roughly
127
water
protectors
[
7
]
directly
across
the
road
from
where
private
security
for
Energy
Transfer
had
unleashed
dogs
[
8
]
on
activists
one
month
earlier
.
)
The
camp
also
intended
to
halt
construction
where
the
remaining
proposed
pipeline
route
would
connect
with
the
Missouri
River
.

Four
days
after
declaring
eminent
domain
for
the
camp
,
on
October
27
,
law
enforcement
from
seven
states
arrived
there
fully
equipped
with
riot
gear
,
all
-
terrain
vehicles
,
armored
vehicles
and
helicopters
.
They
arrested
141
water
protectors
[
9
]
—
after
beating
them
with
batons
and
issuing
pepper
spray
.
Law
enforcement
ultimately
destroyed
the
camp
,
along
with
its
tipis
and
sweat
lodges
.

“
We
did
everything
in
our
power
that
we
could
do
to
defend
our
camp
in
a
nonviolent
approach
,
”
says
Cody
Hall
of
the
<[>Cheyenne
River
Sioux
Tribe<]>
.
“
Because
the
only
way
to
really
defend
it
would
have
became
a
violent
approach
because
you're
meeting
officers
with
a
force
of
weaponry
.
”

“
We
still
honor
those
treaties
,
and
I
know
the
chairman
has
said
that
he
expects
America
to
do
the
same
.
”

There
are
now
talks
of
using
the
treaty
to
legally
regain
land
rights
to
end
the
pipeline's
construction
,
according
to
Hall
and
others
on
-
site
.
There
is
a
precedent
for
taking
this
approach
:
In
May
,
the
Lummi
in
Washington
state
called
on
the
U
.
S
.
<[>Army
Corps
of
Engineers<]>
to
reject
a
coal
terminal
permit
on
the
premise
that
it
would
harm
Lummi
fishing
grounds
,
which
the
federal
government
is
legally
mandated
to
protect
per
an
1855
treaty
.
The
Lummi
won
[
10
]
.
No
terminal
was
built
,
fishing
grounds
were
not
harmed
and
the
treaty
was
honored
.

“
[
DAPL
]
brings
to
the
surface
all
the
issues
dealing
with
treaties
,
"
says
<[>Bald
Eagle<]>
.
"
It
brings
up
all
the
wrongdoings
that
have
been
happening
in
the
past
.
The
American
government
has
repeatedly
shoved
all
of
their
wrongdoings
underneath
the
rug
,
and
the
issue
with
the
Dakota
Access
Pipeline
has
pulled
that
rug
off
,
and
now
we
have
to
look
at
everything
that’s
been
done
wrong
.
”

He
lays
out
three
choices
for
the
U
.
S
.
government
:
correct
its
wrongs
,
put
the
rug
back
or
commit
another
wrong
.

President
Barack
Obama
[
11
]
,
when
interviewed
by
social
media
news
site
<[>NowThis<]>
,
stated
that
the
<[>Corps<]>
is
figuring
out
[
12
]
how
to
reroute
the
pipeline
over
the
next
several
weeks
,
saying
,
"
There
is
a
way
for
us
to
accommodate
sacred
lands
of
Native
Americans
.
"
But
construction
has
nearly
reached
the
Missouri
River
,
sacred
water
for
the
Sioux
.
Several
more
weeks
may
be
too
late
.
