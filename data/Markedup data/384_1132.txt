You
spouted
off
a
bunch
of
rancid
garbage
(which
you
are
known
for)
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
I
asked
(which
you
are
also
known
for).
So,
how
about
it?
Just
name
one
thing
that
Hoggs
has
gotten
right.
Also,
if
you
are
going
to
call
people
“loosers”,
you
may
want
to
check
your
spelling.
I
can
see
a
dictionary
in
your
mother’s
basement
there.
Check
it
out,
loser.
