A
look
at
the
university’s
new
mission.

Jonathan
Haidt,
a
professor
of
social
psychology
at
New
York
University,
argued
in
a
recently
published
essay
that
while
its
traditional
“telos”
(end
or
goal)
has
been
truth,
within
the
last
few
decades
the
university
has
assumed
another:
Social
Justice.

The
university,
however,
can
only
have
one
telos.

The
conflict
between
these
two
goals
has
raged
for
decades,
Haidt
claims.
Last
year,
though,
it
became
unmanageable
when
student
groups
at
86
universities
and
colleges
around
the
country
issued
“
demands
”
to
administrators,
demands
for
Social
Justice
that,
by
and
large,
were
met.

The
following
statement
is
posted
at
BlackLiberationCollective.org
:

“We
demand
at
the
minimum,
Black
students
and
Black
faculty
to
be
reflected
by
the
national
percentage
of
Black
folk
in
the
state
and
the
country.

We
demand
free
intuition
for
Black
and
indigenous
students.

We
demand
a
divestment
from
prisons
and
an
investment
in
communities.”

A
statement
of
“principles”
follows.
The
Black
Liberation
Collective
(BLC)
opposes
“anti-Blackness;”
“sexism;”
“ableism;”
“capitalism;”
“White
privilege;”
“inequality;”
and
“heteronormativity.”
It
rejects
as
well
non-violence
considered
as
a
principle
in
contradistinction
to
a
tactic
.

“Anti-Black
racism
is
woven
in
the
fabric
of
our
global
society,”
says
the
BLC.
“When
social
systems
are
racialized
by
white
supremacy,
whiteness
becomes
the
default
of
humanity
and
Blackness
is
stripped
of
its
humanity,
becoming
a
commodity,
becoming
disposable.”

The
BLC
is
“anti-sexist”
insofar
as
it
affirms
“the
value
of
all
Black
women’s
lives
whether
cisgender,
transgender,
or
genderqueer.”
In
addition
to
rejecting
“Eurocentric
beauty
standards
that
are
made
to
lessen
the
beauty
of
Black
women
and
Black
women’s
features,”
being
“anti-sexist”
also
means
realizing
that
“police
brutality,
the
prison
industrial
system,
school
to
prison
pipeline”
and
the
like
are
aspects
of
“structural
racism”
that
affect
black
women
as
much
as
they
impact
black
men.

Black
liberation
entails
“queer
liberation”
and
“trans
liberation.”
“We
also
seek
to
destroy
the
heteronormative
norms
that
dehumanize
Black
queer
people,”
the
BLC
asserts.
The
“homophobia”
within
“the
Black
community”
comes
by
way
of
“the
same
hands
responsible
for
white
supremacy.”

Presumably,
“transphobia”
within
the
black
community
is
also
a
legacy
of
white
supremacy.
In
cooperation
with
“cissexism”
and
“the
gender
binary,”
“transphobia”
has
“been
used
as
a
means
of
invalidating
and
erasing
our
trans+
family
members.”
The
BLC
pledges
to
“eliminate”
such
systemic
biases.

These
Social
Justice
Warriors
(SJWs)
are
staunch
opponents
of
“the
capitalist
notions
of
infinite
profit,
homogenized
markets,
and
a
privatized
means
of
production.”
Capitalism,
they
insist,
“is
the
economic
system”
that’s
been
“used
to
justify”
the
“oppression,”
“marginalization,”
and
“exploitation”
of
blacks.

Nor
is
the
solution
to
this
“oppression”
to
be
found
in
supporting
black-owned
businesses.
The
BLC
explains
that
“we
cannot
adopt
the
patriarchal,
exploitative
tools
of
our
oppressors
as
we
seek
liberation.”
Rather,
the
solution
is
to
“dismantle
anti-Black
capitalist
corporations
that
benefit
from
our
oppression.”

It
isn’t
only
the
“capitalist
corporations”
that
these
students
want
destroyed.
They
demand
as
well
“the
eradication
of
all
institutional
practices
and
policies
that
discriminate
against
the
black
community”
and
“the
removal
of
all
federal,
state,
and
local
government
officials
who
do
not
abide
by
our
principles.”

“The
State
and
all
its
institutions
that
deny
Black
humanity
and
Black
agency
must
be
dismantled
and
replaced
with
those
that
produce
Black
liberty.”

Concerning
its
attitude
toward
America,
the
BLC
is
clear:
“This
country
was
built
to
systematically
oppress
groups
of
people,
and
the
Black
Liberation
Collective
will
not
stand
for
it.”

Haidt
misspeaks
in
characterizing
2015
as
the
year
when
the
university
experienced
a
crisis
of
identity,
an
unmanageable
conflict
of
goals.
To
judge
from
the
vast
majority
of
liberal
arts,
humanities,
and
social
sciences
departments,
Social
Justice
long
ago
eclipsed
truth
as
the
raison
d’etre
of
the
academy.
Interestingly,
it
is
these
SJW
demands
from
last
year
that
bear
this
out.

Perhaps
it
is
because
I’ve
spent
the
last
couple
of
decades
in
the
academy
in
the
capacity
of
both
student
and
faculty
that
I
may
be
more
privy
to
this
than
are
some
others,
but
it’s
painfully
obvious
that
these
student
activists
did
not
come
up
with
these
demands
on
their
own.
If
they
didn’t
have
their
professors
actually
write
the
demands
for
them,
then
the
Black
Liberation
Collective
unquestionably
derived
the
concepts
and
language
of
their
statement
of
demands
from
their
mentors.

To
put
it
bluntly,
one
must
attend
college,
major
in
the
liberal
arts
and
humanities,
and
study
under
far
left
professors
in
order
to
think
in
the
terms
that
are
characteristic
of
Social
Justice
Warriors.

Leftist
ideologues
are
training
their
students
to
bend
the
university
to
their
will.
This
is
the
first
point.
There
is,
though,
another,
a
rich
irony
that
is
lost
upon
these
self-styled
radicals.

For
all
of
their
bluster
over
“systemic
racism”
and
“structural
white
supremacy,”
i.e.
phenomena
that
are
omnipresent
and,
hence,
largely
unconscious,
these
black
students,
their
white
collaborators,
and
their
professors
fail
to
realize
that
their
thinking
(for
lack
of
a
better
term)
on
these
issues
is
about
as
Eurocentric
as
one
can
get.
The
“
critical
race
theory
”
to
which
the
BLC
subscribe
is
a
version
of
Marxism,
the
philosophical
vision
of
a
19
th
century
German-Jewish
man.
The
Marxist
tradition
within
which
they
are
enmeshed
was
fleshed
out
over
a
span
of
generations
by
mostly
white
heterosexual
men.

But
there’s
more
to
it
than
this.

The
idea
that
“racism,”
“sexism,”
“homophobia,”
“transphobia,”
“ableism,”
and
the
like
against
which
SJWs
rail
are
evils
to
be
defeated
is
itself
peculiar
to
the
moral
traditions
of
European
civilization.
If
these
“isms”
and
“phobias”
are
immoral
it
can
only
be
because
those
who
are
guilty
of
them
fail
to
judge
the
individual
as
an
individual.
Color,
gender,
sexual
orientation,
ability,
and
so
forth
are
neither
constitutive
of
nor
essential
to
the
moral
identity
of
the
individual—but
only
if
the
framework
of
the
doctrine
of
individualism
is
accepted.

Yet
this
conception
of
the
sacrosanct
individual
is
as
Eurocentric
as
the
proverbial
“apple
pie”
is
American.

The
Social
Justice
Warriors’
intellectual
landscape
is
as
much
a
European
“colony”
as
was
any
West
African
country
in
the
19
th
or
early
20
th
centuries.
Those
in
the
Black
Liberation
Collective
have
most
definitely
internalized
the
modes
of
thought
of
their
“oppressor.”

Now,
they
would
have
been
well
aware
of
all
this
had
they
received
a
genuine
education
in
college
rather
than
a
training
in
Social
Justice.
