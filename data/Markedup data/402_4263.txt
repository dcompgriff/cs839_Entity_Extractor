On
Wednesday,
Nov.
9,
2016,
Republican
lawmakers
arranged
to
meet
with
President-elect
Donald
Trump’s
advisors
to
talk
about
another,
less
expensive,
option
to
his
“mighty
wall.”
The
President-elect
also
consistently
told
his
supporters
he
would
dismantle
Obama
Care,
but
now
he
says
that
he
is
open
to
keeping
the
Affordable
Care
Act.
This
recent
waffling
could
be
an
indicator
that
he
will
not
deliver
on
his
campaign
promises.
The
day
after
he
won
the
election,
he
was
given
his
first
test
by
his
own
party.
According
to
top
aides
for
Trump,
there
is
a
compromise
that
would
include
more
federal
border
patrol
officers,
and
extend
the
border
fence.
The
idea
is
to
extend
parts
of
the
border
with
a
double
layered
fence.
An
official
from
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
and
a
Republican
from
the
House
of
Representatives
said
Trump’s
wall
is
improbable;
it
would
have
to
be
built
through
rivers
and
lakes,
rough
terrain
and
private
property.
It
would
also
block
the
view
of
border
agents.
This
wall
would
make
it
difficult
to
watch
the
border.
According
to
the
House
Aid,
the
meeting
will
take
place
as
soon
as
his
transition
team
is
set.
The
spokesperson
would
not
offer
any
comment
on
the
meeting
or
compromise
plan
from
the
lawmakers.
Mexico
again
said
the
day
after
the
election
they
would
not
pay
for
his
wall.
The
wall
has
never
been
mentioned
officially,
but
if
Congress
takes
a
stand
against
Trump
it
will
be
an
extension
of
the
fence
once
proposed
by
Secretary
Clinton.
According
to
the
House
aide,
the
meeting
will
take
place
as
soon
as
the
transition
team
is
set.
The
spokesperson
would
not
comment
on
the
meeting
or
the
compromise
from
lawmakers.
Mexico
again
stated,
the
day
after
the
election,
they
will
not
pay
for
his
wall.
This
boundary
has
not
been
mentioned
officially,
but
if
Congress
takes
a
stand
against
Trump
it
will
be
an
extension
of
the
fence,
once
proposed
by
Secretary
of
State
Hillary
Clinton.
Another
key
focus
of
the
presidential
campaign
was
immigration.
It
was
stated
that
illegal
immigrants
are
stealing
American
jobs
and
pose
a
security
risk
to
the
nation.
Chairman
of
the
House
Homeland
Security
Committee
Michael
McCaul
called
the
idea
of
the
wall,
an
emotional
unthinking
reaction
to
a
highly
sensitive
issue,
or
a
“knee-jerk
reaction.”
Another
indication
that
the
president-elect
will
not
deliver
on
his
campaign
promises.
The
day
after
the
election
Marie
Keating,
a
first-grade
teacher
in
California,
asked
her
10
students
what
they
wanted
to
ask
new
President-elect
Trump.
One
student
said
she
did
not
want
her
family
to
be
sent
back
to
Mexico.
This
statement
prompted
Keating
to
have
her
class
write
letters
telling
Trump
what
was
on
their
mind.
Little
Nicole
asked
him
to
be
kind
and
to
always
tell
the
truth,
and
not
to
incite
violence
between
people
of
color.
Another
little
girl
asked
him
to
allow
people
of
different
races
to
be
friends.
A
little
boy
asked
him
not
to
say
that
people
who
do
not
have
white
skin
are
all
robbers.
Another
little
girl
said
simply
that
she
hoped
he
did
not
start
a
war,
and
another
asked
that
he
not
send
them
back
to
Mexico.
Keating
posted
the
letters
on
Facebook
for
everyone
to
see.
She
was
proud
of
her
students
because
they
asked
for
things
that
were
necessary
for
them,
in
a
respectful
way.
Anthony
Scaramucci,
the
creator
of
hedge-fund
Skybridge
Capital
and
one
of
Trump’s
top
advisors,
says
Americans
should
take
President-elect
Trump
at
his
word.
He
believes
he
will
build
a
wall
–
if
he
says
he
will.
When
New
York
Magazine
asked
him
how
it
would
be
possible
to
have
Mexico
pay
for
the
wall,
he
responded,
that
the
U.S.
could
charge
an
excise
tax
on
goods
coming
into
the
country
from
Mexico.
However,
he
also
said
the
American
people
did
the
right
thing
by
electing
Trump.
The
interviewer
corrected
him,
stating
that
American’s
voted
for
Clinton,
not
Trump.
Scaramucci
replied
he
did
not
see
that
way.
If
President-elect
Trump
wants
to
build
a
wall,
he
will
have
to
convince
Congress
using
a
cost-efficient
plan.
The
Affordable
Care
Act
has
provided
millions
of
people
with
health
insurance,
at
an
affordable
premium.
The
average
cost
of
health
insurance
within
the
marketplace,
after
the
110
percent
rise,
will
be
$78
a
month.
The
newly
elected
president-elect
has
changed
his
mind
on
repealing
the
health
coverage.
He
states
that
he
is
willing
to
keep
the
Affordable
Care
Act
and
instead,
make
the
needed
changes.
Therefore,
it
is
entirely
possible,
Trump
will
not
deliver
on
some
of
his
campaign
promises.
