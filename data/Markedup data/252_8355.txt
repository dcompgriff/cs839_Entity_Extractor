Working

Arranging
Israel-Palestine
Summit

Since
the
United
States
cannot
or
will
not
act
as
an
honest
broker
in
the
middle
east,
Russia
is
taking

Russia
continues
to
conduct
a
thorough
preparation
for
the
first
Israeli-Palestinian
summit
in
Moscow
in
order
to
ensure
that
it
does
not
become
"a
meeting
for
the
sake
of
the
meeting,"
Russian
Deputy
Foreign
Minister
Gennady
Gatilov
said
on
Friday.

"Here
you
need
to
strive
for
it
to
be
done
at
the
appropriate
time.
It
is
necessary
to
conduct
a
thorough
preparation
for
the
meeting
so
that
it
would
really
be
productive
…
not
just
a
meeting
for
the
sake
of
the
meeting,"
Gatilov
said
during
his
visit
to
Israel.

Israeli
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu
and
Palestinian
President
Mahmoud
Abbas
earlier
announced
their
support
for
Moscow’s
effort
to
mediate
any
talks
on
the
resolution
of
Israeli-Palestinian
conflict,
but
laid
responsibility
on
each
other
for
the
fact
that
the
meeting
had
not
been
agreed
yet.

In
late
September,
Russian
Foreign
Minister
Sergey
Lavrov
told
a
press
conference
following
his
address
to
the
UN
General
Assembly
that
Moscow
continued
working
with
both
Israel
and
Palestine
to
resume
negotiations,
noting
that
the
parties
were
not
equally
eager
to
consider
the
initiative.
