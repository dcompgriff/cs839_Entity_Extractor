Editor’s
Note:
Alex
Jones
has
spent
most
of
his
career
warning
us
about
the
dangers
of
the
Jesuit-Nazi-Eugenicists.
Now,
it
appears
that
he
has
finally
mustered
the
courage
to
discuss
Jewish
influence.

Radio
host
and
Donald
Trump
supporter
Alex
Jones
ranted
Tuesday
about
“the
Jewish
mafia”
that
controls
the
U.S.,
and
accused
the
prominent
Jewish
Emanuel
family
of
being
at
the
center
of
it.

Jones,
who
has
interviewed
Trump
on
his
show,
went
on
a
long
harangue
on
the
show,
in
which
he
denied
being
anti-Semitic,
but
seemed
to
blame
Jews
for
all
the
problems
in
American
society,
Media
Matters
reported.

“‘Cause
let
me
tell
you,
the
Emanuels
are
mafia,”
Jones
said
of
Chicago
Mayor
Rahm
Emanuel,
a
former
chief
of
staff
for
President
Barack
Obama,
and
his
also
prominent
Jewish
brothers,
Ari
and
Ezekiel.
“And
you
know,
I
was
thinking,
they’re
always
trying
to
claim
that
if
I
talk
about
world
government
and
corruption
I’m
anti-Semitic,
there’s
mafias
of
all
different
stripes
and
groups,
but
since
you
want
to
talk
about
it,
the
Emanuels
are
Jewish
mafia.”

Jones
went
on
to
accuse
Jews
of
controlling
American
society.

“But
I
mean
it’s
not
that
Jews
are
bad,
it’s
just
they
are
the
head
of
the
Jewish
mafia
in
the
United
States.
They
run
Uber,
they
run
the
health
care,
they’re
going
to
scam
you,
they’re
going
to
hurt
you,”
he
said.

In
December,
Trump
appeared
on
“The
Alex
Jones
Show,”
where
the
then-candidate
for
the
Republican
presidential
nomination
