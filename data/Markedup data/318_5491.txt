–
Economic
signals
are
everywhere,
from
magazine
covers
to
grocery
stores
to
military
events.
They
reveal
the
story
of
the
world
economy.
Central
bankers
have
done
their
best
to
conjure
forth
inflation
in
the
hopes
that
this
will
vanquish
deflation
but
the
risk
is
that
our
daily
lives,
and
the
sustainability
of
governments,
will
be
affected
by
an
ongoing
battle
between
these
two
forces.
There
will
be
important
consequences.
Quantitative
Easing
is
now
catching
people
in
a
vice
by
pushing
up
their
cost
of
living
even
as
their
income
is
still
falling.
This
breaks
the
vital
social
contracts
between
citizens
and
their
governments
and
sets
in
motion
many
seemingly
unrelated
outcomes:
social
unrest
in
emerging
markets,
the
movement
of
manufacturing
and
jobs
back
to
the
US
and
the
West,
improvements
to
the
value
added
of
emerging
market
firms,
higher
food
and
energy
prices.
The
rising
price,
but
shrinking
size,
of
a
steak,
a
candy
bar
and
an
apartment
not
only
cause
pain
at
home,
they
also
propel
some
nations
to
deploy
their
militaries
to
secure
resources
and
protect
their
citizens
from
the
ill
effects
of
inflation
and
deflation
alike.
This
is
already
resulting
in
military
confrontations,
incidents
and
near
misses
between
American,
Chinese
and
Russian
planes,
warships
and
submarines.
The
solution
is
growth
and
innovation.
Luckily,
anonymous
individuals
are
balancing
their
hubris
against
the
risk
of
failure
and
proceeding
to
build
a
more
dynamic
economy
and
the
new
social
contracts
that
will
exist
tomorrow.
The
only
question
is
whether
governments
are
hostile
or
hospitable
to
these
efforts.
By
being
alert
to
the
many
signals
around
us
anyone
can
better
navigate
through
the
turbulence
to
the
treasures
of
the
world
economy
instead
of
being
continuously
overwhelmed
and
surprised
by
it.

All
the
Presidents’
Bankers:
The
Hidden
Alliances
that
Drive
American
Power
–
Who
rules
America?

All
the
Presidents’
Bankers
is
a
groundbreaking
narrative
of
how
an
elite
group
of
men
transformed
the
American
economy
and
government,
dictated
foreign
and
domestic
policy,
and
shaped
world
history.

Culled
from
original
presidential
archival
documents,
All
the
Presidents’
Bankers
delivers
an
explosive
account
of
the
hundred-year
interdependence
between
the
White
House
and
Wall
Street
that
transcends
a
simple
analysis
of
money
driving
politics—or
greed
driving
bankers.

Prins
ushers
us
into
the
intimate
world
of
exclusive
clubs,
vacation
spots,
and
Ivy
League
universities
that
binds
presidents
and
financiers.
She
unravels
the
multi-generational
blood,
intermarriage,
and
protégé
relationships
that
have
confined
national
influence
to
a
privileged
cluster
of
people.
These
families
and
individuals
recycle
their
power
through
elected
office
and
private
channels
in
Washington,
DC.

All
the
Presidents’
Bankers
sheds
new
light
on
pivotal
historic
events—such
as
why,
after
the
Panic
of
1907,
America’s
dominant
bankers
convened
to
fashion
the
Federal
Reserve
System;
how
J.
P.
Morgan’s
ambitions
motivated
President
Wilson
during
World
War
I;
how
Chase
and
National
City
Bank
chairmen
worked
secretly
with
President
Roosevelt
to
rescue
capitalism
during
the
Great
Depression
while
J.P.
Morgan
Jr.
invited
Roosevelt’s
son
yachting;
and
how
American
financiers
collaborated
with
President
Truman
to
construct
the
World
Bank
and
IMF
after
World
War
II.

Prins
divulges
how,
through
the
Cold
War
and
Vietnam
era,
presidents
and
bankers
pushed
America’s
superpower
status
and
expansion
abroad,
while
promoting
broadly
democratic
values
and
social
welfare
at
home.
But
from
the
1970s,
Wall
Street’s
rush
to
secure
Middle
East
oil
profits
altered
the
nature
of
political-financial
alliances.
Bankers’
profit
motive
trumped
heritage
and
allegiance
to
public
service,
while
presidents
lost
control
over
the
economy—as
was
dramatically
evident
in
the
financial
crisis
of
2008.

This
unprecedented
history
of
American
power
illuminates
how
the
same
financiers
retained
their
authoritative
position
through
history,
swaying
presidents
regardless
of
party
affiliation.
All
the
Presidents’
Bankers
explores
the
alarming
global
repercussions
of
a
system
lacking
barriers
between
public
office
and
private
power.
Prins
leaves
us
with
an
ominous
choice:
either
we
break
the
alliances
of
the
power
elite,
or
they
will
break
us.
