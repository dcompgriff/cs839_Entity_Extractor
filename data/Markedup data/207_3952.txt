Unthinkable
If
it
ever
were
discovered
that
the
voting
was
total
bullshit
(and
I'm
not
suggesting
that)
and
that
they
decided
in
2008
that
Hillary
was
next,
then
chaos
would
ensue.
It's
just
a
passing
thought
but
there
has
been
so
much
fraud
discovered
so
far
by
Hillary,
like
the
debate
questions
given
in
advance
and
the
meetings
with
reporters
which
influenced
the
Electoral
College
before
the
election.
So
you
know
what
I
think?
I
say
we
send
in
the
military
to
grab
all
the
voting
machines
and
do
the
election
entirely
on
paper.
Even
if
it
takes
two
weeks
to
count
the
votes.
Just
saying.
