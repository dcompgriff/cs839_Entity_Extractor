The
president
and
Hillary
Clinton
share
a
“stubborn
desire”
to
avoid
scrutiny.

The
President
of
the
United
States,
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
world,
is
working
three
shifts
for
his
designated
successor,
former
First
Lady
and
Secretary
of
State
Hillary
Clinton.
As
the
FBI
continues
its
investigations
and
Clinton
emails
continue
to
emerge,
it
is
worth
recalling
the
mysteries
in
the
president’s
narrative.

Last
year,
“Obama’s
narrator,”
as
the
New
York
Times
called
David
Axelrod,
released
his
massive
Believer
:
My
Forty
Years
in
Politics
.
The
author
recalls
a
“perfectly
timed”
and
unexpected
call
that
would
change
his
life.

“David,
it’s
Barack,”
said
the
voice
on
the
phone.
“I’m
thinking
about
what
I
want
to
do
next,
and
was
wondering
if
we
could
talk.”
This
call
took
place
in
1992,
which
explains
the
perfect
timing.

On
February
8,
1992,
the
president’s
maternal
grandfather
Stanley
Dunham
passed
away
at
73.
So
“Gramps,”
as
the
narrator
called
him,
was
no
longer
around
to
offer
insights
on
family
history,
correct
any
accounts
that
might
appear,
or
write
one
of
his
own.

In
the
1995
Dreams
from
My
Father,
Gramps
“might”
say
that
a
Kenyan
foreign
student
looks
a
lot
like
Nat
King
Cole.
Actually,
Gramps
might
not.
The
Kenyan
student
Barack
H.
Obama
bears
little
resemblance
to
Cole,
who
passed
away
in
1965
but
enjoyed
a
revival
in
the
1990s
through
daughter
Natalie’s
“Unforgettable”
album.

The
narrator
of
Dreams
from
My
Father
invokes
“a
stubborn
desire
to
protect
myself
from
scrutiny”
and
he
“doesn’t
fault
people
their
suspicions”
if
they
fail
to
take
him
at
“face
value.”
His
elusive
father
is
a
“prop
in
someone
else’s
narrative”
and
“an
image
I
could
alter
on
a
whim
or
ignore
when
convenient.”
The
narrative
itself
is
a
“myth,”
a
“tale,”
and
a
“useful
fiction.”

Dreams
from
My
Father
has
no
photo
section,
no
index,
and
key
characters
get
only
a
first
name.
These
include
“Frank,”
who
gets
2,500
words.
Back
in
1995,
the
president
himself
identified
this
person
as
Frank
Marshall
Davis,
the
Stalinist
Paul
Kengor
regards
as
the
president’s
mentor,
as
he
explained
in
The
Communist:
The
Untold
Story
of
Frank
Marshall
Davis
.

In
Dreams
from
My
Real
Father
,
documentarian
Joel
Gilbert
made
a
case
that
Davis
is
the
president’s
biological
father.
Malik
Obama,
son
of
the
Kenyan
Barack
H.
Obama,
sees
a
strong
physical
resemblance
.
That
also
holds
true
on
the
policy
side.
Professor
Kengor
found
“remarkable
similarities”
between
the
writings
of
Davis
and
the
policies
of
president
Barack
Obama.

The
Kenyan
Barack
Obama,
though
a
man
of
the
left,
was
not
a
pro-Soviet
Communist.
Had
he
been
pro-Soviet,
he
would
have
attended
Patrice
Lumumba
University
in
Moscow.
Indeed,
Obama
warned
his
fellow
Kenyans
about
Soviet
meddling
in
Africa.

The
Kenyan
Obama
would
have
found
strange
the
president’s
2009
cancelation
of
missile
defense
for
European
allies.
An
outspoken
man,
he
would
not
have
supported
the
kind
of
high-tech
harassment
Sharyl
Attkisson
described
in
Stonewalled:
My
Fight
for
Truth
Against
the
Forces
of
Obstruction,
Intimidation
and
Harassment
in
Obama’s
Washington
.

The
Kenyan
Barack
H.
Obama
had
issues
with
strongman
types
such
as
Jomo
Kenyatta,
who
ruled
Kenya
from
1963
until
his
death
in
1978.
In
keeping
with
his
country,
and
most
of
Africa,
the
Kenyan
Barack
Obama
is
not
on
record
as
a
supporter
of
homosexual
causes.
Frank
Marshall
Davis,
on
the
other
hand,
was
certainly
on
board.
As
Davis
wrote
in
his
1992
memoir
Livin’
the
Blues
:

“During
the
dramatic
civil
rights
demonstrations
of
the
1960s,
I
often
thought
we
ought
to
form
a
united
front
with
joint
sit-ins
at
cafes.
In
my
mind
I
envisioned
the
result.
An
indignant
white
restaurant
manager
frantically
phoning
the
police,
‘Get
here
in
a
hurry!
We
got
niggers
at
our
counters
and
our
washrooms
are
loaded
with
fairies
and
lesbians!’
Or
perhaps
there
might
have
been
a
joint
March
on
Washington
waving
banners:
Blacks
and
Homos,
Arise!”

That,
and
Davis’
pornographic
novel,
Sex
Rebel:
Black
,
might
explain
the
president’s
stubborn
desire
to
protect
himself
from
scrutiny.
It
could
also
have
something
do
with
what
the
narrator
calls
the
“less
flattering
aspects
of
my
father’s
character.”

In
Dreams
from
My
Father
,
the
Kenyan
is
raised
a
Muslim
but
in
The
Audacity
of
Hope
he
is
“a
confirmed
atheist,
thinking
religion
to
be
so
much
superstition,
like
the
mumbo-jumbo
of
witch
doctors
that
he
had
witnessed
in
the
Kenyan
villages
of
his
youth.”

In
Audacity
,
the
narrator
explains
that
he
went
to
a
“predominantly
Muslim
school”
in
Indonesia.
He
does
not
indicate
whether
atheists,
Lutherans,
Jews,
or
Buddhists
also
attended
the
school.
Registration
records
were
supposedly
destroyed
by
flooding.

The
predominantly
Muslim
school
also
emerges
in
Believer
,
but
Axelrod
does
not
indicate
if
students
of
other
faiths
attended.
Frank,
Ann
Dunham,
Stanley
Dunham,
and
even
the
Kenyan
Barack
Obama
are
missing
from
this
account,
but
it
proves
enlightening
in
other
ways.

In
a
2008,
Brian
Williams
of
MSNBC
asked
presidential
candidates
what
steps
they
would
take
in
the
event
of
a
simultaneous
terror
attack
on
major
American
cities.
As
Axelrod
explains,
“Obama
neglected
to
include
that
he
would
pursue
the
perpetrators.”

Hillary
Clinton
did
likewise
in
2012,
passing
off
what
she
privately
regarded
as
a
terrorist
attack
on
the
U.S.
compound
in
Benghazi
as
a
spontaneous
protest
over
a
video.
Like
the
president,
Clinton
has
always
shown
a
stubborn
desire
to
protect
herself
from
scrutiny.
With
BleachBit
,
hammers
and
lies,
Hillary
and
her
handlers
did
their
best
to
make
more
than
30,000
emails
disappear.

The
contents
remain
something
of
a
mystery,
just
as
mysteries
linger
about
the
president
and
his
background.
On
the
other
hand,
by
now
some
things
are
perfectly
clear.

The
POTUS
and
former
FLOTUS
both
decline
to
identify
Islamic
terrorism.
Both
are
shrink-wrapped
in
statist
superstition.
And
both
lie
with
the
greatest
of
ease.
On
these
counts,
like
the
critters
in
Orwell’s
Animal
Farm,
one
can
find
it
“impossible
to
say
which
was
which.”

Back
in
July,
the
party
faithful
were
chanting
“Four
more
years!”
during
the
president’s
speech
at
the
Democratic
National
Convention.
