IT
HAS
come
to
our
attention
that
there
is
quite
a
lot
of
tension
building
up
between
the
world
superpowers
with
many
reputable
news
publications
like
the
Daily
Mail
,
Irish
Mirror
and
the
World
Weekly
News
hinting
at
a
third
instalment
of
the
planet’s
World
War
series
.
In
lieu
of
this
fact
,
we
have
carefully
compiled
a
handy
guide
for
world
leaders
to
follow
in
a
bid
to
prevent
such
a
sequel:

First
thing
a
world
superpower
should
do
if
they
want
to
avoid
such
a
mess
,
is
spend
half
the
country’s
entire
annual
revenue
on
‘military
stuff’
.
After
all
,
you
can’t
prevent
a
world
war
unless
you
have
your
cards
in
the
game
,
right
?
Sure
,
there
maybe
millions
of
people
starving
in
your
country
,
rising
racial
tensions
you
need
to
address
,
and
health
care
that
needs
supporting
,
but
none
of
that
makes
any
sense
if
you
don’t
spend
that
600
billion
dollars
on
war
preventing
things
,
like
nuclear
warheads
and
helmets
.

To
end
any
possible
conflict
,
every
good
leader
knows
that
strategically
placing
missile
bases
on
the
perimeter
of
your
rival
nation
is
the
first
step
to
peace
.
Run
drill
after
drill
along
their
border
to
show
them
that
you
too
are
also
willing
to
solve
this
crisis
in
a
reasonable
and
mature
manner
.
This
is
key
to
abating
any
World
War
.
NOTE:
Best
done
in
a
former
country
owned
by
your
rival
.

As
a
spokesperson
of
a
large
country
full
of
millions
of
people
,
communication
between
your
nation
and
the
other
is
key
.
Daily
news
publications
should
by
now
be
your
best
bet
as
you
try
and
reason
with
the
other
side
.
Let
thousands
of
sensible
journalists
do
the
negotiating
for
you
with
a
series
of
well
written
and
researched
articles
outlining
why
it
is
that
war
is
a
terrible
idea
.
Put
your
absolute
trust
in
their
foresight
and
ability
to
word
certain
scenarios
correctly
.
Never
question
the
editors
of
such
publications
as
they
know
better
than
you
,
and
most
of
all
,
never
ever
hold
a
journalist
responsible
for
the
pieces
they
write
.
These
people
are
your
greatest
ally
when
preventing
war
.
Just
leave
them
to
it
.

If
things
get
really
heated
,
send
a
flotilla
of
naval
vessels
past
your
oppositions
coastline
.
They’ll
get
your
sense
of
humour
and
will
love
you
more
for
it
.
Invade
one
of
the
old
countries
you
used
to
own
.
Show
them
that
you
think
just
like
them
.
Fly
some
bombers
into
their
airspace
.
After
all
,
aren’t
we
all
the
same
at
the
end
of
the
day
?

The
final
and
most
important
thing
in
preventing
a
war
is
to
showcase
your
military
muscle
on
a
proxy
nation
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything
you
,
or
your
rival
nation
is
doing
.
Use
the
moment
to
show
them
,
and
the
entire
world
,
the
sophisticated
products
of
your
military
spend
.
Try
and
entice
your
foe
into
doing
the
same
.
Call
it:
a
practice
run
,
dick
measuring
contest
,
fighting
ISIS
,
whatever
the
fuck
you
like
.
Just
make
sure
to
stack
up
those
innocent
dead
and
mutilated
bodies
like
they
did
in
the
good
old
days
of
WW
I
&
WWII
,
and
blame
it
on
the
other
side
.
That
should
stop
this
whole
bloody
mess
.
