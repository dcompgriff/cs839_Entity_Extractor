Incidents
of
“bake
shaming”
have
increased
by
600
%
since
Wednesday
evening’s
Bake
Off
final
,
say
police
.

Bake
shaming
,
legally
classified
as
abuse
aimed
at
“those
who
haven’t
seen
,
or
don’t
really
care
about
,
The
Great
British
Bake
Off”
has
become
more
of
a
problem
since
the
announcement
that
the
programme
will
be
crossing
channels
next
year
.

One
victim
,
Kevin
Dunsford
,
who
has
lived
his
whole
life
in
this
country
was
“bake
shamed”
at
his
local
bus
stop
.
He
told
our
reporter:
I
was
standing
with
my
wife
and
we
were
talking
about
the
weather
and
a
woman
walked
up
,
looked
at
us
in
disbelief
and
said
,
“Why
aren’t
you
talking
about
Bake
Off
?
”
She
then
started
ranting
on
about
British
Values
and
called
us
an
“unwelcome
minority”
.

Home
Secretary
,
Amber
Rudd
,
said
she
was
appalled
by
this
situation
and
condemned
these
acts
as
“despicable”
.
She
added
,
“Our
cake
crime
laws
are
among
the
best
in
the
world
.
