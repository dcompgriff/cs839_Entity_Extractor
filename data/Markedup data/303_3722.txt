Obama
Donations
Funneled
Through
Fake
Bonuses



This
is
some
great
investigative
work
.
And
it's
the
kind
of
story
that
flies
under
the
radar
and
it's
just
a
small
component
of
the
Democratic
machine
.
But
it
is
what
the
setup
looks
like
.

Jon
Tester
didn’t
come
all
the
way
from
Montana
for
the
scrambled
eggs
and
bacon
.
The
US
senator
,
virtually
unknown
in
Boston
,
was
in
a
conference
room
at
the
<[>Thornton
Law
Firm<]>
that
June
morning
to
cash
in
at
one
of
the
most
reliable
stops
on
the
Democratic
fund
-
raising
circuit
,
a
law
firm
that
pours
millions
into
the
coffers
of
the
party
and
its
politicians
.

Tester
,
a
massive
,
jovial
man
who
raises
livestock
on
his
family
farm
,
was
more
compelling
than
many
of
the
other
breakfast
guests
,
all
of
them
political
candidates
the
firm
hoped
would
defend
the
interests
of
trial
attorneys
.
But
the
drill
was
basically
the
same
.
The
personal
injury
lawyers
listened
politely
for
a
few
minutes
,
then
returned
to
their
offices
.
And
Tester
walked
away
with
$
26
,
400
in
checks
.

But
a
striking
thing
happened
the
day
Tester
visited
in
2010
.
Partner
David
C
.
Strouss
received
a
payment
from
the
firm
labeled
as
a
“
bonus
”
that
exactly
equaled
his
$
2
,
400
contribution
to
Tester’s
campaign
,
the
maximum
allowed
.
A
few
days
later
,
partner
Garrett
Bradley
—
until
recently
the
<[>House<]>
assistant
majority
leader
on
Beacon
Hill
—
got
a
bonus
,
too
,
exactly
matching
his
$
2
,
400
gift
to
Tester
.

That's
quite
a
coincidence
.

From
2010
through
2014
,
Strouss
and
Bradley
,
along
with
founding
partner
Michael
Thornton
and
his
wife
,
donated
nearly
$
1
.
6
million
to
<[>Democratic
Party<]>
fund
-
raising
committees
and
a
parade
of
politicians
—
from
Senate
minority
leader
Harry
Reid
of
Nevada
to
Hawaii
gubernatorial
candidate
David
Ige
to
Senator
Elizabeth
Warren
of
Massachusetts
.
Over
the
same
span
,
the
lawyers
received
$
1
.
4
million
listed
as
“
bonuses
”
in
<[>Thornton
Law
Firm<]>
records
;
more
than
280
of
the
contributions
precisely
matched
bonuses
that
were
paid
within
10
days
.

No
corruption
to
see
here
.
Now
let's
move
on
to
another
fake
scandal
.

Thornton’s
lawyers
were
especially
generous
to
Vice
President
Joe
Biden
,
one
of
Washington’s
strongest
advocates
for
trial
lawyers
,
contributing
more
than
$
78
,
000
to
his
campaigns
from
2003
to
2008
.

During
President
Obama
and
Biden’s
reelection
campaign
in
2012
,
Michael
Thornton
hosted
a
fund
-
raiser
for
the
<[>Obama
Victory
Fund<]>
at
his
house
in
Cambridge
,
where
Biden
was
the
guest
of
honor
.
Some
of
the
biggest
donors
—
some
Thornton
partners
gave
$
20
,
000
—
were
escorted
into
a
private
room
and
offered
the
chance
to
be
photographed
with
Biden
,
said
someone
who
was
there
.
Thornton
records
show
the
lawyers
were
reimbursed
for
those
donations
.

Hope
and
change
.
