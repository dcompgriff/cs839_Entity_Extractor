The
Media
Lost
All
of
Its
Political
Power
Last
Night
--
Thank
You,
Donald
Trump!

The
morally
dark
Obama-era
is
over
and
utterly
and
totally
repudiated.
The
Clintons
have
finally
and
forever
been
staked
in
their
mercenary
black
hearts.
Our
smug,
supremacist
overlords
in
the
Elite
Establishment
of
both
Parties,
these
rotting,
rent-seeking
parasites,
are
now
vanquished.
But
nothing
is
grander,
nothing
is
more
glorious,
nothing
is
more
satisfying,
nothing
is
sweeter,
nothing
is
more
validating,
nothing
is
better
for
America
than
the
death
of
the
mainstream
media's
political
power.

The
elite
national
political
media
is
done
as
a
force,
moral
or
otherwise,
in
this
country.
Done.
Buried.
Exposed.
Over.
Out.
And
using
a
slow-acting
poison
called
hubris,
it
was
death
by
suicide.
So
smug.
So
sure
of
themselves.
So
sanctimonious.
So
snark-filled.
So
utterly
incapable
of
anything
close
to
self-reflection.

The
self-induced
poison
took
effect
over
a
number
of
years
and
through
five
steps.

Here
they
are.

1.
Pimping
for
ObamaCare

The
national
political
media
didn’t
just
cheerlead
for
ObamaCare,
they
LIED
to
us.
Willfully
and
with
malicious
intent,
they
all
lied
to
us.
The
outlawing
of
almost
every
existing
insurance
plan
was
right
there
in
the
bill,
right
there
in
black
and
white.
But
the
media
didn't
care.
They
wanted
to
give
their
Precious
Obama
a
win
and
in
order
to
do
that,
they
jumped
on
board
the
"You
Can
Keep
Your
Insurance"
propaganda
express.
Worse,
those
of
us
who
did
tell
the
truth
were
branded
as
liars
and
racists,
not
only
by
the
pundits
but
by
those
godforsaken
fact-checkers.

Then
Utopia
met
reality.

Then
the
lies
were
exposed.

And
the
result
is
that
up
to
and
including
last
night,
at
both
the
local
and
national
level,
ObamaCare
has
decimated
the
Democrat
Party.
But
nowhere
near
as
bad
as
it
has
decimated
the
middle
class.

The
media's
role
in
this
is
unforgivable
and
destroyed
whatever
remained
of
their
moral
authority.
From
here
on,
they
could
only
get
more
sweaty,
desperate,
and
dangerous.

2.
Casting
off
Every
Journalistic
Ethic
to
Destroy
Trump

Openly,
proudly,
and
belligerently,
in
order
to
hijack
a
presidential
election,
we
were
treated
to
the
Pompous
Announcement
that
Trump
was
such
a
threat
to
humanity,
it
was
now
time
for
journalists
throughout
the
land
to
cast
off
every
standard
that
makes
journalism
journalism,
starting
with
objectivity.

Even
former
good
guys
like
CNN's
Jake
Tapper
morphed
into
an
unrecognizable
LyingSnarkVirtueSignalingMachines
--
another
rotting
cog
in
the
Narrative
Wheel,
a
mindless
member
of
a
self-deluded,
government-worshiping
cult
that
wouldn’t
piss
on
Middle
America
if
we
were
on
fire.

Professional
sobriety
was
cast
off
because
this
one
was
in
the
bag,
baby!
And
who
could
miss
the
historic
opportunity
to
self-righteously
point-and-laugh
at
the
hideous
rubes
as
they
were
finally
and
forever
being
buried
alive
under
a
Brave
New
World.

3.
Grind
Donald
Trump
To
Dust

While
there
is
no
question
Trump
deserved
a
few
of
the
kitchen
sinks
hurled
his
way,
never
in
my
50
years
have
I
seen
such
a
coordinated,
desperate,
dishonest,
and
poisonous
campaign
to
disqualify
a
human
being
through
the
dark
art
of
stripping
him
and
his
supporters
of
all
their
humanity.

4.
Embracing
Confirmation
Bias

The
longer
the
general
election
rolled
on,
the
smaller
the
bubble
of
self-delusion
became.

Inconvenient
polls
were
sneered
at
and
Voxsplained
away.

Exit
polls
could
only
means
ONE
thing,
even
though
it
was
pretty
clear
they
might
mean
another.

My
personal
favorite
was
the
late
editorials
where,
based
on
no
counted
votes
whatsoever,
we
were
trolled
with
the
news
that
it
was
Hillary,
not
Trump,
who
would
emerge
victorious
with
the
"hidden
vote!"
Oh,
the
delicious
irony
of
that.
Oh,
how
lovely
it
would
be
to
rub
that
in
the
rubes'
faces
on
Election
Night.

By
the
time
the
votes
were
actually
being
counted,
I
was
about
60%
sure
Hillary
would
win.
The
New
York
Times,
however,
was
92%
sure.
ABCNBCCBSAPBSNPRCNNWashingtonPostPolitico
were
100%
sure.

But
even
I
understood
that
state
and
local
polls
were
more
erratic
than
ever,
that
Hillary
did
seem
legitimately
freaked
about
the
upper
Midwest,
that
the
best
pollster
in
the
country
had
Trump
up
+2,
that
Trump
never
lost
his
fervent
base,
that
the
right
track/wrong
track
numbers
had
been
upside
down
for
a
decade,
that
there
was
still
a
larger-than-usual
number
of
undecideds,
that
this
thing
that
was
Real
might
not
be
enough
to
win,
but
it
was
still
Real.

No,
no,
we
were
told,
it's
all
smoke
and
mirrors,
all
gold-leafed
Trump
Steaks.
Look
at
Obama's
approval
ratings!
Look
at
the
Hispanic
vote!
Look
at
this
squirrel
and
that
squirrel
and
the
other
squirrel
over
there.
Sit
down,
son,
don’t
you
understand
that
I'm
a
data
machine?
It's
science,
rube.
Don't
you
Vox,
racist?

And
then
the
worst
thing
imaginable
happened….

5.
The
Media
Lost
the
Election

The
hate,
the
lies,
the
removal
of
the
mask
of
objectivity,
the
pushing
of
every
single
chip
into
the
middle
of
the
table
--
that
can
actually
work
…
IF
YOU
WIN.

But
the
media
didn’t
win.

In
the
most
spectacular
fashion,
with
their
pants
down
and
their
bare
ass
hanging
out
for
the
world
to
see,
they
lost.

And
with
that
loss
went
EVERYTHING.

And
now
the
media
is
exposed
in
front
of
the
whole
world
as
a
Swaggering
Potemkin
Bully
that
no
longer
has
the
power
to
sway
public
opinion,
even
when
they
throw
absolutely
everything
they
have
at
one
man,
and
do
so
with
much
of
the
Republican
Party
on
their
side.

Not
only
has
the
media
forever
been
exposed
as
brazenly
dishonest
and
laughably
out
of
touch,
worse
than
all
that,
they
are
exposed
as
WEAK,
a
force
no
one
need
ever
fear
or
kowtow
to
again.

Without
that
sheen
of
fear,
without
that
threat
of
intimidation,
like
a
vanquished
bully,
so
goes
all
their
power.

F***
you,
mainstream
media.

--

The
delicious
irony
of
all
this
is
that
the
last
desperate
gasp
of
the
political
media
did
actually
prove
their
precious
Barack
Obama
correct
about
one
thing…

The
moral
arc
of
history
does
indeed
bend
towards
justice.
