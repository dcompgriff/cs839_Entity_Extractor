New

Admits
Key
Al
Qaeda
Role
In
Aleppo
In
a
backhand
way,
The
New
York
Times
admits
that
the
U.S.-backed
“moderate”
rebels
in
east
Aleppo
are
fighting
alongside
Al
Qaeda
jihadists,
an
almost
casual
admission
of
this
long-obscured
reality,
writes
Robert
Parry.

As
much
as
The
New
York
Times
and
the
mainstream
U.S.
media
have
become
propaganda
outlets
on
most
foreign
policy
issues,
like
the
one-sided
coverage
of
the
bloody
Syrian
war,
sometimes
the
truth
seeps
through
in
on-the-ground
reporting
by
correspondents,
even
ones
who
usually
are
pushing
the
“propo.”

Such
was
the
case
with
Anne
Barnard’s
new
reporting
from
inside
west
Aleppo,
the
major
portion
of
the
city
which
is
in
government
hands
and
copes
with
regular
terror
rocket
and
mortar
attacks
from
rebel-held
east
Aleppo
where
Al
Qaeda
militants
and
U.S.-armed-and-funded
“moderate”
rebels
fight
side-by-side.

Almost
in
passing,
Barnard’s
article
on
Sunday
acknowledged
the
rarely
admitted
reality
of
the
Al
Qaeda/”moderate”
rebel
collaboration,
which
puts
the
United
States
into
a
de
facto
alliance
with
Al
Qaeda
terrorists
and
their
jihadist
allies,
fighting
under
banners
such
as
Nusra
Front
(recently
renamed
Syria
Conquest
Front)
and
Ahrar
al-Sham.

Barnard
also
finally
puts
the
blame
for
preventing
civilians
in
east
Aleppo
from
escaping
the
fighting
on
a
rebel
policy
of
keeping
them
in
harm’s
way
rather
than
letting
them
transit
through
“humanitarian
corridors”
to
safety.
Some
of
her
earlier
pro-rebel
accounts
suggested
that
it
wasn’t
clear
who
was
stopping
movement
of
civilians
through
those
corridors.

However,
on
Sunday,
she
reported:
“We
had
arrived
at
a
critical
moment,
as
Russia
said
there
was
only
one
day
left
to
pass
through
a
corridor
it
had
provided
for
people
to
escape
eastern
Aleppo
before
the
rebel
side
was
flattened,
a
corridor
through
which
precious
few
had
passed.
The
government
says
rebels
are
preventing
civilians
from
leaving.
Rebels
refuse
any
evacuation
without
international
supervision
and
a
broader
deal
to
deliver
humanitarian
aid.”

Granted,
you
still
have
to
read
between
the
lines,
but
at
least
there
is
the
acknowledgement
that
rebels
are
refusing
civilian
evacuations
under
the
current
conditions.
How
that
is
different
from
Islamic
State
terrorists
in
Mosul,
Iraq,
preventing
departures
from
their
areas
–
a
practice
which
the
Times
and
other
U.S.
outlets
condemn
as
using
women
and
children
as
“human
shields”
–
isn’t
addressed.
But
Barnard’s
crimped
admission
is
at
least
a
start.

Barnard
then
writes:
“Instead
[of
allowing
civilians
to
move
through
the
humanitarian
corridors],
they
[the
rebels]
are
trying
to
break
the
siege,
with
Qaeda-linked
groups
and
those
backed
by
the
United
States
working
together
—
the
opposite
of
what
Russia
has
demanded.”

Again,
that
isn’t
the
clearest
description
of
the
situation,
which
is
stunning
enough
that
one
might
have
expected
it
in
the
lede
rather
than
buried
deep
inside
the
story,
but
it
is
significant
that
the
Times
is
recognizing
that
Al
Qaeda
and
the
U.S.-backed
“moderates”
are
“working
together”
and
that
Russia
opposes
that
collaboration.

She
also
noted
that
“Three
Qaeda-linked
suicide
bombers
attacked
a
military
position
with
explosive-packed
personnel
carriers
on
Thursday,
military
officials
said,
and
mortar
fire
was
raining
on
neighborhoods
that
until
now
had
been
relatively
safe.
It
was
among
the
most
intense
rounds
in
four
years
of
rebel
shelling
that
officials
say
has
killed
11,000
civilians.”

While
she
then
throws
in
a
caveat
about
the
impossibility
of
verifying
the
numbers,
the
acknowledgement
that
the
U.S.-backed
“moderate”
rebels
and
their
Al
Qaeda
comrades
have
been
shelling
civilians
in
west
Aleppo
is
significant,
too.
Before
this,
all
the
American
people
heard
was
the
other
side,
from
rebel-held
east
Aleppo,
about
the
human
suffering
there,
often
conveyed
by
“activists”
with
video
cameras
who
have
depicted
the
conflict
as
simply
the
willful
killing
of
children
by
the
evil
Syrian
government
and
the
even
more
evil
Russians.

More
Balance

With
the
admission
of
rebel
terror
attacks
on
civilians
in
west
Aleppo,
the
picture
finally
is
put
into
more
balance.
The
Al
Qaeda
and
U.S.-backed
rebels
have
been
killing
thousands
of
civilians
in
government-controlled
areas
and
the
Syrian
military
and
its
Russian
allies
have
struck
back
only
to
be
condemned
for
committing
“war
crimes.”

Though
the
human
toll
in
both
sides
of
Aleppo
is
tragic,
we
have
seen
comparable
situations
before
–
in
which
the
U.S.
government
has
supported,
supplied
and
encouraged
governments
to
mount
fierce
offensives
to
silence
rockets
or
mortars
fired
by
rebels
toward
civilian
areas.

For
instance,
senior
U.S.
government
officials,
including
President
Barack
Obama
and
Democratic
presidential
nominee
Hillary
Clinton,
have
defended
Israel’s
right
to
defend
itself
from
rockets
fired
from
inside
Gaza
even
though
those
missiles
rarely
kill
anyone.
Yet,
Israel
is
allowed
to
bomb
the
near-defenseless
people
of
Gaza
at
will,
killing
thousands
including
the
four
little
boys
blown
apart
in
July
2014
while
playing
on
a
beach
during
the
last
round
of
what
the
Israelis
call
“mowing
the
grass.”

In
the
context
of
those
deaths,
U.S.
Ambassador
to
the
United
Nations
Samantha
Power,
who
has
built
her
career
as
a
supposed
humanitarian
advocating
a
“responsibility
to
protect”
civilians,
laid
the
blame
not
on
the
Israeli
military
but
on
fighters
in
Gaza
who
had
fired
rockets
that
rarely
hit
anything
besides
sand.

At
the
United
Nations
on
July
18,
2014,
Power
said
,
“
President
Obama
spoke
with
[Israeli]
Prime
Minister
Netanyahu
this
morning
to
reaffirm
the
United
States’
strong
support
for
Israel’s
right
to
defend
itself….
Hamas’
attacks
are
unacceptable
and
would
be
unacceptable
to
any
member
state
of
the
United
Nations.
Israel
has
the
right
to
defend
its
citizens
and
prevent
these
attacks.”

But
that
universal
right
apparently
does
not
extend
to
Syria
where
U.S.-supplied
rockets
are
fired
into
civilian
neighborhoods
of
west
Aleppo.
In
that
case,
Power
and
other
U.S.
officials
apply
an
entirely
different
set
of
standards.
Any
Syrian
or
Russian
destruction
of
east
Aleppo
with
the
goal
of
suppressing
that
rocket
fire
becomes
a
“war
crime.”

Perhaps
it’s
expected
that
the
U.S.
government,
like
other
governments,
will
engage
in
hypocrisy
regarding
affairs
of
state:
one
set
of
rules
for
U.S.
allies
and
another
for
countries
marked
for
U.S.
“regime
change.”
Statements
by
supposed
“humanitarians”
–
such
as
Samantha
Power,
“Ms.
R2P”
–
are
no
exception.

But
double
standards
are
even
more
distasteful
when
they
come
from
allegedly
“objective”
journalists
such
as
those
who
work
at
The
New
York
Times,
The
Washington
Post
and
other
prestige
American
news
outlets.
When
they
take
the
“U.S.
side”
in
a
dispute
and
become
crude
propagandists,
they
encourage
the
kind
of
misguided
“group
thinks”
that
led
to
the
criminal
Iraq
War
and
other
disastrous
“regime
change”
projects
over
the
past
two
decades.

Yet,
that
is
what
we
normally
see.
A
thoughtful
reader
can’t
peruse
the
international
reporting
of
the
U.S.
mainstream
media
without
realizing
that
it
is
corrupted
by
propaganda
from
both
government
officials
and
from
U.S.-funded
operations,
often
disguised
as
“human
rights
activists”
or
“citizen
journalists”
whose
supposed
independence
makes
their
“propo”
even
more
effective.

So,
it’s
worth
noting
those
rare
occasions
when
The
New
York
Times
and
the
rest
of
the
MSM
let
some
of
the
reality
peek
through.
When
evaluating
the
latest
plans
from
Hillary
Clinton
and
other
interventionists
to
expand
the
U.S.
military
intervention
in
Syria
–
via
prettily
named
“safe
zones”
and
“no-fly
zones”
–
the
American
people
should
realize
that
they
are
being
asked
to
come
to
the
aid
of
Al
Qaeda.
