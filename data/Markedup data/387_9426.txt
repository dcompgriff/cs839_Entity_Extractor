This
past
week,
peaceful
protesters
were
brutally
arrested
at
Standing
Rock
in
North
Dakota
attempting
to
protect
their
water
from
the
Dakota
Access
Pipeline,
which
threatens
the
water
of
more
than
18
million
people
in
the
US.
Journalists
and
medics
were
arrested,
cars
were
impounded
and
personal
possessions
were
seized
by
police.
Once
again,
government
officials
brutalize
and
raise
up
arms
against
native
people
in
a
fight
to
steal
yet
more
land
and
destroy
it.
It
is
clear
to
see
that
Morton
County
Sheriff’s
office
is
the
primary
security
protecting
the
construction
of
this
pipeline.
However,
amidst
the
chaos,
many
forgot
a
small
victory
that
occurred
last
week;
nearly
50
water
protectors
stood
against
more
than
250
police
on
a
bridge
on
County
Road
134.
As
Desiree
Kane
of
Yes!
Magazine
reports:
It
was
a
strategic
juncture
because
police
vehicles
couldn’t
cross
the
narrow
embankments
on
their
way
to
the
raid.
If
they
were
stopped
at
this
bridge
from
the
east,
they
could
only
come
from
the
north.
In
the
morning,
police
did
come,
and
from
both
sides.
When
I
arrived,
this
blockade
had
already
stopped
an
LRAD…
Even
as
police
numbers
grew,
eventually
well
beyond
200,
the
water
protectors
held
their
ground,
fearless.
Then
the
dancing
began.
People
began
dancing
to
a
hand
drum,
entranced
by
the
power
of
prayer.
One
elderly
man
continuously
proclaimed
in
a
loud
voice,
“Send
one
unarmed
like
I
am
out
here
to
negotiate.
Please.
We
are
protecting
the
water
for
our
children
and
yours.
Send
one
out
here
to
negotiate.
Let’s
talk!
Please!”
The
police
refused
to
negotiate,
but
after
hours
of
this
peaceful
display
of
non-cooperation,
the
police
retreated.
This
means
that
those
250
jackbooted
thugs
could
not
make
it
from
the
east
to
join
in
the
brutalizing
of
peaceful
protesters.
This
is
a
victory,
no
matter
how
small.
