In
a
recent
post
,
“Why
do
you
believe
what
you
believe”
we
said:
“Why
do
you
know
the
sun
causes
skin
cancer
?
You
know
it
because
years
ago
you
read
it
in
,
or
heard
it
from
,
a
trusted
source
.
Then
you
read
and
heard
it
often
again
,
and
the
repetition
caused
you
to
believe
it
more
and
more
until
you
know
it
.
The
combination
of
“trusted
source”
and
“repetition”
inserts
belief
into
our
minds
,
and
once
there
,
it
may
be
difficult
to
dislodge
—
unless
we
are
exposed
to
a
more
trusted
source
plus
repetition
.
As
you
know
,
consuming
saturated
fat
and
cholesterol
increases
your
risk
of
heart
disease
,
while
sugar
does
not
.
You
have
heard
this
from
many
trusted
sources
and
it
has
been
repeated
endlessly
in
all
forms
of
communication
.

Sugar
industry
sought
to
sugarcoat
causes
of
heart
disease
Payments
revealed
to
authors
of
influential
1967
report
touting
fat
and
cholesterol
as
problems
,
by
LAURA
BEIL
Using
records
unearthed
from
library
storage
vaults
,
researchers
recently
revealed
that
the
sugar
industry
paid
nutrition
experts
from
Harvard
University
to
downplay
studies
linking
sugar
and
heart
disease
.
Although
the
incident
happened
in
the
1960s
,
it
appears
to
have
helped
redirect
the
scientific
narrative
for
decades
.
Harvard
University
—
what
could
be
a
more
trusted
source
than
Harvard
University
?
Note
however
,
that
Harvard
University
does
not
conduct
research
,
nor
does
<[>Harvard
University<]>
verify
the
findings
of
research
.
Research
is
done
by
people
,
employees
of
<[>Harvard<]>
,
and
being
employees
of
<[>Harvard<]>
gives
those
researchers
no
special
insight
or
virtue
.
Yet
the
mere
association
with
the
name
<[>“Harvard<]>
,
”
implies
intelligence
and
academic
trustworthiness
.
The
documents
show
that
the
<[>Sugar
Research
Foundation<]>
paid
professors
who
wrote
a
two
-
part
review
in
1967
in
the
<[>New
England
Journal
of
Medicine<]>
.
That
report
was
highly
skeptical
of
the
evidence
linking
sugar
to
cardiovascular
problems
but
accepting
of
the
role
of
fat
.
The
now
-
deceased
professors’
overall
conclusion
left
“no
doubt”
that
reducing
the
risk
of
heart
disease
was
a
matter
of
reducing
saturated
fat
and
cholesterol
,
according
to
researchers
from
the
<[>University
of
California<]>
,
San
Francisco
,
who
published
their
report
online
September
12
in
JAMA
Internal
Medicine
.
Now
,
we
have
the
<[>University
of
California<]>
,
San
Francisco
,
another
trusted
source
,
impugning
the
trusted
<[>Harvard<]>
results
.
The
sugar
industry
helped
deflect
the
way
the
research
was
developing
,
”
says
study
coauthor
Cristin
Kearns
,
a
dentist
at
<[>UCSF’s
Institute
for
Health
Policy
Studies<]>
.
The
belief
in
sugar’s
innocence
,
and
the
sugar
industry’s
profit
motive
,
were
so
powerful
,
it
took
a
dentist
,
not
a
cardiologist
to
uncover
apparently
biased
results
from
what
ostensibly
was
a
heart
study
.
Following
the
publication
of
the
Harvard
report
,
fat
and
cholesterol
went
on
to
hijack
the
scientific
agenda
for
decades
,
and
even
led
to
a
craze
of
low
-
fat
foods
that
often
added
sugar
.
It
was
only
in
2015
that
dietary
guidelines
finally
made
a
strong
statement
to
limit
sugar
.
Researchers
writing
this
year
in
Progress
in
Cardiovascular
Diseases
note
that
current
studies
estimate
that
diets
high
in
added
sugars
carry
a
three
times
higher
risk
of
death
from
cardiovascular
disease
.
(
The
<[>Sugar
Association<]>
says
in
a
statement
on
its
website
that
“
the
last
several
decades
of
research
have
concluded
that
sugar
does
not
have
a
unique
role
in
heart
disease
.
”
)
Is
this
an
example
of
deception
with
a
true
statement
?
Yes
,
unfortunately
,
the
last
several
decades
of
research
did
absolve
sugar
from
blame
,
and
what
does
“unique
role
in
heart
disease”
really
mean
?
If
sugar
causes
heart
disease
,
is
that
a
“unique
role”
?
The
<[>Sugar
Association’s<]>
statement
acknowledged
the
secret
deal
occurred
,
but
pointed
out
that
“when
the
studies
in
question
were
published
,
funding
disclosures
and
transparency
standards
were
not
the
norm
they
are
today
.
”
Translation:
The
research
lied
,
but
back
then
,
we
didn’t
have
to
reveal
the
lie
.
So
,
it’s
O
.
K
.
Journals
now
require
all
authors
to
list
conflicts
of
interest
,
especially
funding
from
a
source
has
a
vested
interest
in
the
outcome
.
While
a
modern
researcher
could
not
take
corporate
money
,
even
for
speaking
fees
,
without
disclosure
,
the
influences
may
be
more
subtle
,
he
says
.
“We’re
not
talking
about
making
up
data
,
but
perhaps
influencing
how
a
research
question
is
framed
.
”
Revealing
the
source
of
funding
doesn’t
eliminate
bias
.
And
,
though
one
reasonably
may
conclude
that
a
high
percentage
of
private
funding
comes
from
sources
with
an
ax
to
grind
,
that
doesn’t
necessarily
mean
the
research
results
are
misleading
.
But
,
such
funding
leads
to
the
question:
“What
happens
to
results
that
disagree
with
the
benefactor’s
purpose
?
If
several
,
slightly
different
pieces
of
research
show
that
sugar
has
an
adverse
effect
on
heart
health
,
and
one
shows
it
doesn’t
,
what
happens
to
all
the
negative
research
?
Andy
Bellatti
,
cofounder
and
strategic
director
of
<[>Dietitians
for
Professional
Integrity<]>
says
that
researchers
don’t
necessarily
want
to
be
cozy
with
industry
,
but
sometimes
turn
to
commercial
sources
because
non
-
biased
research
money
is
lacking
.
“The
reason
the
food
industry
is
able
to
do
this
is
because
there
is
such
little
public
funding
for
nutrition
and
disease
.
”
Here
is
yet
another
example
,
among
hundreds
,
of
how
cuts
in
federal
deficit
spending
hurt
America
,
though
often
benefitting
big
business
.
And
what
does
the
need
for
an
organization
titled
,
“
<[>Dietitians
for
Professional
Integrity”<]>
tell
you
about
today’s
food
research
?
The
scientific
community
should
not
reject
industry
money
wholesale
,
says
John
Sievenpiper
,
a
physician
and
nutrition
researcher
at
the
<[>University
of
Toronto<]>
.
He
believes
that
any
scientist
who
takes
industry
money
should
adhere
to
an
even
higher
standard
of
openness
,
including
releasing
study
protocols
ahead
of
time
so
reviewers
can
make
sure
the
research
question
was
not
changed
midstream
to
favor
a
certain
conclusion
.
Bottom
line:
For
many
years
,
your
belief
in
“benign
sugar”
was
created
by
“trusted
sources”
and
repetition
.
As
with
privately
owned
banks
,
the
profit
motive
encourages
unethical
behavior
.
Corporations
do
not
fund
research
out
of
generosity
.
They
consider
research
to
be
part
of
their
marketing
efforts
.
Negative
results
often
are
twisted
or
hidden
.
Researchers
,
whether
employed
by
<[>Harvard
University<]>
,
the
<[>University
of
California<]>
,
a
private
organization
,
or
working
alone
,
all
can
be
swayed
,
consciously
or
not
,
to
tilt
their
interpretations
in
favor
of
the
money
supply
.
Cuts
in
federally
funded
Research
&
Development
grants
are
misguided
if
the
primary
purpose
is
to
“save
the
federal
government
money”
or
to
“make
government
smaller”
(
a
huge
,
often
unacknowledged
disadvantage
of
libertarianism
)
.
While
the
federal
government
has
political
motives
,
it
does
not
have
a
profit
motive
,
and
that
alone
helps
make
it
a
more
trusted
source
for
food
&
drug
research
than
is
private
industry
.
