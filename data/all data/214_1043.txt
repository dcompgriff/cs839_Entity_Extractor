GERMAN
‘GESTAPO’
considers
prosecuting
parents
who
refused
to
allow
their
son
to
go
on
a
field
trip
to
mosque
Parents
of
a
German
teenager
may
face
a
trial
for
refusing
to
pay
‘truancy’
fine
after
refusing
to
allow
their
son
to
go
to
a
local
mosque
on
a
school
field
trip
out
of
fear
that
it
would
lead
to
his
indoctrination
by
Muslim
leaders
.

The
story
broke
in
mid
-
June
,
when
parents
of
a
13
-
year
-
old
student
opposed
the
idea
of
their
son
visiting
a
mosque
in
the
northern
German
town
of
Rendsburg
,
reportedly
organized
as
part
of
a
geography
class
.
“What
a
trip
to
the
mosque
has
to
do
with
geography
classes
?
”
Arthur
Dent
asked
.
Others
compared
the
authorities’
actions
to
the
darkest
part
of
German
history
,
with
one
user
tweeting:
“Visiting
mosques
is
a
top
priority
under
our
regime
,
similar
to
having
a
Fuhrer’s
image
in
everyone’s
flat
.
”
In
a
letter
to
the
class
teacher
quoted
by
the
<[>NDR<]>
,
the
teen’s
father
argued
that
his
son
would
be
“indoctrinated”
in
the
mosque
.
He
went
on
to
say
that
“for
years
we
have
been
hearing
reports
about
religiously
-
motivated
violence
connected
with
Islamic
people
.
”
The
parents’
lawyer
,
Alexander
Heumann
,
argues
that
they
refused
the
school
trip
out
of
fear
for
their
son’s
“bodily
safety
.
”
Denying
any
faith
-
based
motives
,
he
emphasized
that
the
couple
do
not
belong
to
any
religious
group
,
and
are
of
the
opinion
that
“nobody
shall
be
forced
into
a
sacred
place
against
his
good
will
.
”
Heumann
himself
,
however
,
is
a
former
member
of
the
Alternative
for
Germany
party
,
an
anti
-
immigrant
political
group
,
and
was
a
participant
in
setting
up
the
‘Dugida
,
’
a
Dusseldorf
-
based
branch
of
the
far
-
right
<[>PEGIDA<]>
movement
.
According
to
the
<[>NDR<]>
report
,
the
parents
met
the
lawyer
through
the
<[>‘Pax
Europa’<]>
movement
,
a
civic
group
which
opposes
the
perceived
“Islamization
of
Europe
.
”
A
local
education
authority
subsequently
fined
the
couple
a
total
of
€300
(
$
328
)
.
When
the
parents
opposed
the
fine
,
their
case
was
forwarded
to
Peter
Mueller
-
Rakow
,
a
local
prosecutor
,
who
will
decide
whether
or
not
to
proceed
with
a
court
trial
.
