Recognizing
,
as
I’m
sure
we
all
do
,
that
every
speech
Barack
Obama
has
ever
given
is
a
work
of
oratory
genius
and
each
monologue
is
more
memorable
than
the
last
,
I
ask
that
you
think
back
to
his
final
State
of
the
Union
speech
.

Amongst
the
ramblings
from
one
statist
government
giveaway
to
the
next
was
a
segment
on
what
the
President
classified
as
the
<[>White
House
Cancer
Moonshot<]>
.
Obama
stated
on
January
12
,
2016
that
,
“last
year
Vice
President
Biden
said
that
with
a
new
moonshot
,
America
can
cure
cancer
.
”

I’m
not
making
light
of
this
statement
,
and
certainly
not
of
Biden
,
for
he
lost
his
son
Beau
Biden
to
brain
cancer
in
May
of
2015
.

Obama
continued
by
saying
that
,
“last
month
he
[
Biden
]
worked
with
<[>Congress<]>
to
give
scientists
at
the
<[>National
Institutes
of
Health<]>
,
the
strongest
resources
they’ve
had
in
over
a
decade
.
”
He
received
a
standing
ovation
from
virtually
ever
member
in
the
chamber
.

This
is
my
problem
.
Not
that
Biden
lost
his
son
to
cancer
and
wishes
for
no
one
else
to
suffer
the
way
his
son
and
family
did
.
I
get
that
.
It’s
the
way
almost
everyone
in
government
proposes
to
solve
the
problem
.
It’s
always
the
same
.
The
<[>federal
government<]>
ponies
up
billions
of
dollars
of
our
money
to
fund
quasi
-
government
science
projects
,
which
rarely
if
ever
accomplish
anything
.

However
laudable
this
particular
goal
may
be
,
it
is
not
in
the
<[>federal
government's<]>
job
description
to
be
funding
medical
research
.
And
to
me
,
knowing
the
feds
as
I
do
–
this
seems
to
me
to
be
another
case
of
not
letting
a
good
crisis
go
to
waste
.

Some
may
say
this
is
a
jaded
opinion
and
that
Obama
and
Biden
are
trying
to
help
cure
cancer
.
How
could
I
possibly
be
against
that
?
I’m
not
,
of
course
–
but
I
am
jaded
,
and
for
good
reason
.
I
would
love
to
see
a
cure
for
all
cancers
,
but
government
involvement
in
everything
invariably
creates
more
problems
than
it
ever
solves
.
Not
to
mention
that
it
is
just
another
unconstitutional
function
.

Obama
then
stated
that
because
Biden
has
"
gone
to
the
mat
for
all
of
us
on
so
many
issues
over
the
past
forty
years
,
I’m
putting
Joe
in
charge
of
mission
control
.
”
Really
.
Name
three
things
ole
-
Joe
has
“gone
to
mat”
for
us
on
.
Okay
–
how
about
two
.

So
uncle
Joe
Biden
,
with
his
forty
years
in
politics
,
and
zero
years
in
science
or
medicine
,
is
heading
the
<[>White
House
Cancer
Moonshot
Task
Force<]>
.
Other
members
of
the
“Task
Force”
are
from
the
<[>Department
of
Defense<]>
,
<[>Department
of
Commerce<]>
,
<[>Health
and
Human
Services<]>
,
<[>Energy<]>
,
<[>Veteran
Affairs<]>
,
the
<[>OMB<]>
,
<[>National
Economic
Council<]>
,
<[>Domestic
Policy
Council<]>
.
Others
include
the
<[>National
Cancer
Institute<]>
,
<[>Institutes
of
Health<]>
,
and
the
<[>National
Science
Foundation<]>
.

Okay
–
I
get
the
science
institutes
–
but
why
the
<[>Departments
of
Commerce<]>
,
<[>Energy<]>
,
and
others
?
What
do
they
have
to
do
with
curing
cancer
?
Answer
–
nothing
–
of
course
,
but
government
task
forces
need
lots
of
important
people
.
They
won’t
contribute
anything
useful
,
but
it
looks
impressive
.

So
,
almost
a
year
into
the
five
year
Task
Force
plan
–
how
are
things
going
?
Have
they
made
any
progress
–
any
breakthroughs
?
Nope
.
Joe
is
out
making
more
speeches
,
as
he
did
in
June
,
exclaiming
that
“there
is
clear
sense
of
–
let’s
get
it
done
now
.
We
can
do
it
now
.
”
That’s
a
great
sentiment
,
but
having
endless
meetings
and
simply
exclaiming
the
urgency
will
do
absolutely
nothing
.

And
then
ole
-
Joe
said
something
telling
in
his
speech
–
something
Joe
does
quite
often
.
He
said
to
the
scientists
in
the
audience:
“We
call
for
help
and
you
all
answer
.
You
didn’t
need
us
to
call
.
You
were
already
doin
it
.
”

So
,
if
this
is
the
case
–
and
it
is
–
why
do
we
need
this
behemoth
,
billion
dollar
government
taskforce
?
Why
then
do
we
need
this
collaboration
between
actual
cancer
research
and
government
hacks
like
Biden
and
other
bureaucrats
?
The
answer
is
that
this
is
what
statists
do
.
No
matter
what
the
cause
,
government
always
must
inject
itself
and
eventually
take
it
over
.

That
was
June
–
six
months
in
.
A
week
ago
,
closing
in
on
a
year
after
the
Moonshot
announcement
,
Obama
and
Biden
held
a
sit
down
to
report
on
their
progress
.
Obama
stated
that
Joe
has
traveled
the
country
and
had
multiple
meetings
“in
order
to
really
figure
out
how
we
get
this
thing
to
achieve
serious
liftoff
.
”
Yes
–
almost
a
year
in
and
they
are
still
trying
to
figure
how
to
begin
the
Moonshot
.

Obama
then
stated
that
,
although
they
would
be
leaving
office
soon
,
what
they
leave
behind
is
the
framework
for
organizing
these
efforts
.
And
that
in
a
nutshell
,
is
what
the
statist
government
progressive’s
goal
always
is
–
to
build
the
framework
for
continual
governmental
meddling
.
Later
on
,
they
can
get
down
to
picking
winners
and
losers
,
thus
hindering
real
cancer
research
for
those
who
would
rather
not
play
ball
and
tow
the
government
line
,
just
as
it
has
done
with
climate
science
,
energy
,
and
many
other
disciplines
.

Want
to
never
cure
another
cancer
?
The
best
way
to
achieve
this
is
to
announce
that
we
are
from
the
government
and
are
here
to
help
,
support
and
organize
you
